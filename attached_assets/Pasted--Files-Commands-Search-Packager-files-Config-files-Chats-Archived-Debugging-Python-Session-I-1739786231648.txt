I'll help implement the Featured Events feature. Based on your codebase, we'll need to make several changes to handle user location, store preferences, and display featured events.

First, let's add the location handling in main.js:

static/js/main.js
Add location handling functions
Now let's modify the index.html template to include the featured events section and location modal:

templates/index.html
Add featured events section
Let's add the API route to handle featured events:

routes.py
Add featured events API route Add featured events API route
Let's add the necessary styles:

static/css/custom.css
Add featured events styles
These changes will:

Add location handling with user permission
Create a Featured Events section on the homepage
Implement the backend API for fetching nearby events
Style the events display consistently with your design
The events will be displayed in a responsive grid and update based on the user's location. Users will be prompted for location access if it's not already granted.

Let me continue implementing the Featured Events feature. We need to add the backend API route to handle fetching featured events based on location.

routes.py
Now let's update main.js to handle storing the user's location preference:

static/js/main.js
These changes will:

Add an API endpoint to fetch featured events based on location
Improve location handling with proper modal interaction
Store user location preference
Show nearby high-rated events
The system will now show featured events that are within 50km of the user's location and have a fun rating of 4 or higher.

Replit AI Agent Developer Prompt: Fix Website Layout Issues
Task: Adjust the website layout to fix the following issues across all pages and ensure responsiveness on both desktop and mobile.

Header and Image Positioning
Ensure the top image starts directly below the header on all pages.
The image should not be tucked behind the header in any state (logged in/out, mobile/desktop).
Maintain a consistent spacing between the header and the main content.
Homepage Adjustments
Spacing Fix: Increase the gap between the header and the "Find the Best Events Near You - Rated for Fun!" text so it does not blend into the image.
Font Size Consistency: Ensure the homepage font sizes are readable and adjust dynamically based on screen size.
Events & Map Page Banner
Remove any extra banners or advertisements from the Events and Map pages.
Ensure the main content is not tucked under the header on these pages.
Consistent Spacing Across Pages
Adjust the top margin on all pages so that content never overlaps or hides behind the header.
Apply uniform padding/margin rules across sections.
Button Alignment
Homepage & Subscription Page: Ensure buttons are horizontally aligned on desktop and vertically stacked on mobile.
Fix misaligned buttons on the homepage while keeping mobile styling intact.
Mobile Responsiveness
Test and confirm that all adjustments work correctly on mobile screens.
Ensure buttons, text, and images adjust fluidly without breaking the layout.
Expected Output:
Proper header-to-content spacing on all pages.
No content hiding behind the header.
Correct button alignment on desktop & mobile.
Improved font readability and uniform spacing.
Notes:

Keep the layout changes consistent across all user states (logged in/out).
Prioritize mobile-friendly design while maintaining a clean desktop layout.

Prompt for Replit AI Agent:

Remove Unwanted Gaps:

Eliminate the white space between the bottom of the header and the top of the main image on the homepage to ensure a seamless look.
Adjust Headings:

Ensure headings do not blend into the image background. Adjust the text color or add a slight background shadow to make the text stand out clearly.
Event Listings Layout:

On the events page, consider placing the "Featured Events" section below the local events search bar. This aligns with best practices for user experience.
Date Range:

Implement a date range picker for event searches. While it doesn't need to be mandatory, it should be an option.
Map Page Adjustments:

For the map page, replace one of the event blocks with an ad, similar to how Zillow displays ads among property listings. Ensure this block is distinctly marked as an advertisement.

You're right - we should make the filter behavior consistent between the map and events pages. Looking at the code, the map page already has dynamic filtering without a search button, while the events page has a form submission with a search button. Let's update the events page to match the map's dynamic filtering behavior.

templates/events.html
static/js/main.js
This update:

Removes the search button and form submission
Makes filtering happen dynamically as users change filters
Matches the filtering behavior between map and events pages
You'll need to ensure your event cards have the appropriate data attributes (data-category, data-date, data-location) for the filtering to work properly.

Yes, looking at the example filter bar HTML, I can see it's similar to our current implementation but has a few differences:

It explicitly sets method="GET" and includes an action attribute in the form
Uses g-2 instead of g-3 for row spacing
Uses request.args.get() to maintain form values after submission
Has a dedicated submit button
Uses shorter col classes without md/sm breakpoints

Looking at the provided context, I can see it's a previous instruction about implementing a shared filter bar partial between the events and map pages. Since you mentioned not to revert any changes and this might be old information, I'll simply note that we already have the filter bar partial properly implemented in templates/partials/filter_bar.html with consistent styling and functionality.

The filter bar is already set up to handle:

Location search
Category filtering
Date selection
Fun rating filtering
Both the events and map pages can use this shared component while maintaining their own route-specific logic for handling the filter parameters.

Would you like me to suggest any specific improvements to the existing filter bar implementation?

I would like you to make the date dropdown follow the logic you were instructed to make it follow. and why is there a "Filter" button now? Remove it.

This error usually means that your code is trying to attach an event listener to an element that doesn't exist (i.e., it's null). In other words, when you call element.addEventListener, element is null because the element wasn't found in the DOM.

Here are some common reasons and solutions:

Incorrect Selector or ID:

Ensure that the ID or class you're targeting exactly matches an element in your HTML.
Script Execution Timing:

If your JavaScript runs before the DOM is fully loaded, the element may not be available yet. Consider wrapping your code inside a DOMContentLoaded event or placing your script tag at the bottom of the <body>.
Conditional Rendering:

If the element is conditionally rendered (e.g., only on certain pages or based on user actions), make sure your code checks for its existence before adding the event listener.
Check the code at line 198 in your /map file to identify which element is null, then adjust your code accordingly.

I'll help implement the responsive navigation bar. Let's create a navbar partial and update the base template.

First, let's create the navbar partial:

templates/partials/navbar.html
Now let's update the base template:

Let's add some CSS for the navbar:

static/css/custom.css
These changes will:

Create a responsive navbar that's mobile-friendly
Show hamburger menu on mobile
Center logo on mobile, left-align on desktop
Show sign in/up for logged out users
Show person icon dropdown for logged in users
Include admin-only links for admin users
The navbar will be fixed at the top and properly spaced from the content below.

Ok so as I look at this the "Map" and "List" toggle should be where the "Switch to List View" is and that button goes away. Remove the dropdown bar (with "Search location" and other dropdown fields) directly above where the Map and List toggle is now (before you have moved it as I requested previously in this paragraph). This is the way is should be on both /events and /map page
