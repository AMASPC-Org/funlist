Current Status Overview
Immediate Issues
Navigation/Header Layout Issues

Event/Map toggle button partially hidden under main navigation bar
Inconsistent header spacing across pages
Banner ad positioning needs adjustment between header and hero section
Decision made to remove banner ads completely
Location Services Implementation

Currently using custom location prompt
Need to switch to browser's native geolocation API (best practice)
Implementation exists but needs proper integration
Footer Issues

Button styling inconsistencies
Copyright year needs update to 2025
Social media links pending implementation
Technical Stack

Priority Task List
High Priority (Immediate Fixes)
Header/Navigation Layout

/* Suggested fixes for navigation layout */
.navbar {
  z-index: 1030;
}
.toggle-container {
  margin-top: 60px; /* Adjust based on navbar height */
}
Location Services

Remove custom location prompt
Implement browser's native geolocation:
if ("geolocation" in navigator) {
  navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
    const lat = position.coords.latitude;
    const lng = position.coords.longitude;
    map.setView([lat, lng], 12);
  });
