Objective: Implement the frontend AI Gateway pages and navigation for ThurstonAI, using the existing backend endpoints (/api/ai/feed, /api/.well-known/ai-policy.json, /.well-known/ai-policy.json, /api/ai/report).
Instructions:

Open the ThurstonAI project’s client code (React + wouter).

Create the following page components in client/src/pages/ (or the appropriate pages directory), using existing pages like Privacy.tsx and AiSafety.tsx for layout/style reference (shadcn Cards, Buttons, etc.):

AiGateway.tsx

Route: /ai-gateway

Content:

Hero: “ThurstonAI Community AI Gateway” with short description.

“Developer Quickstart” 3-step list:

Read AI Policy & Data License.

Request API key at api@thurstonai.com.

Call /api/ai/feed with X-AI-Key, X-AI-Consumer, X-AI-Purpose.

“Available Endpoints” section listing:

/api/ai/feed – Authenticated AI feed.

/.well-known/ai-policy.json – Machine-readable policy.

/ai-policy – Human-readable AI policy.

/ai-license – AI data license.

/ai-feed-guide – How to use the feed.

/api/ai/report – Admin-only access logs API.

Link buttons to /ai-policy, /ai-license, /ai-feed-guide.

AiPolicy.tsx

Route: /ai-policy

Layout similar to Privacy.tsx (Back to Home button, Card).

Include headings and placeholder text for: Scope, Allowed Uses, Prohibited Uses, Attribution, Rate Limits, Contact.

Mention that the machine-readable version lives at /.well-known/ai-policy.json.

AiLicense.tsx

Route: /ai-license

Layout similar to AiPolicy.tsx.

Placeholder sections: License Grant, Restrictions, Commercial Use, Update Policy, Contact.

AiFeedGuide.tsx

Route: /ai-feed-guide

Layout with:

Info alert: “The AI feed requires authentication headers; browser access without headers will fail.”

Example curl snippet calling https://thurstonai.com/api/ai/feed with headers:

X-AI-Consumer: your-app-name

X-AI-Purpose: search

X-AI-Key: <YOUR_API_KEY>

Table describing required headers and examples.

Example JSON response structure (e.g., { version, generatedAt, items: [...] }), matching current llm-feed.json shape.

Links to /ai-gateway, /ai-policy, /ai-license.

AiReport.tsx

Route: /ai-report (SPA page).

Behavior:

On mount, fetch /api/me to confirm signedIn and roles includes 'admin'.

If not admin, render an “Access denied / Admin only” message.

If admin, call /api/ai/report and display:

Summary cards: total requests, successful, failed, success rate.

Table of recent logs: ts, consumer, purpose, path, success, errorMessage (if any).

Use existing UI components (Cards, Table, Skeleton/Spinner) as needed.

Update the main router (client/src/App.tsx or equivalent) to register these routes:

/ai-gateway → AiGateway

/ai-policy → AiPolicy

/ai-license → AiLicense

/ai-feed-guide → AiFeedGuide

/ai-report → AiReport

Update Navigation component (client/src/components/Navigation.tsx):

Under the appropriate “Resources” or similar menu, add an item:

Label: AI Gateway

href: /ai-gateway

Description: Programmatic access for AI systems.

Update Footer component (client/src/components/Footer.tsx):

Add a new column titled “AI & Developers” with links:

/ai-gateway – AI Gateway

/ai-policy – AI Access Policy

/ai-license – AI Data License

/.well-known/ai-policy.json – Policy JSON (use <a href> rather than Link so it hits the root path).

/ai-feed-guide – AI Feed Guide

/ai-report – AI Access Report (we can show this link to everyone; the API/page will still enforce admin).

Run npm run dev (or the relevant dev command) and verify:

Each new route renders without errors.

Navigation item “AI Gateway” appears and links to /ai-gateway.

Footer “AI & Developers” column appears with working links.

Return:

The new page component source files.

The updated App.tsx, Navigation.tsx, and Footer.tsx snippets.

Screenshots or text confirmation that all new routes load correctly in the browser.
Expected Evidence: Diffs or code blocks for the new pages and router/nav/footer changes, plus a brief note that all 5 SPA routes render successfully.
