🔹 Final Developer Instructions – FunList.ai Enhancements & Improvements
📌 Context & Goals
These updates will:
✅ Improve event accuracy & credibility through Fun Rating validation and user flagging.
✅ Ensure the Fun Assistant is fully integrated with a "Learn More" section.
✅ Add event views tracking to increase engagement and transparency.
✅ Keep the homepage engaging & informative while maintaining SEO best practices.

🔹 1. Update the Fun Rating System (Prevent Overrating Without Blocking Organizers)
✅ What Needs to Be Done:
📌 Event organizers can select any rating they want but must confirm high ratings via a confirmation popup.
📌 Users can flag an event’s rating pre-event if they think it is inaccurate.
📌 After the event starts, users can give their own Fun Rating.
📌 If multiple users flag an event, it is temporarily hidden and sent for admin review.

🛠 Developer Action Steps:
Update the "New Event" form so that when an organizer selects a Fun Rating, a confirmation modal appears if the rating is high for a low-attraction event.

Example message for 5-star rating selection with low attractions:
"Are you sure your event is a 5.0 Fun Rating?
A 5-star event is typically a large-scale experience with multiple attractions.
Please confirm or adjust your rating."

[Yes, Confirm]
[No, Adjust My Rating]
Add a "Report Rating Mismatch" button on event listings before the event starts.

If multiple users flag the rating as inaccurate, the event is sent to admin review, and the organizer is notified to adjust it.
Allow users to submit Fun Ratings AFTER an event has started.

These user-submitted ratings help refine future Fun Ratings for recurring or annual events.
🔹 2. Add "Who Should Attend?" Field to the Event Form
📌 Users need to know who an event is best suited for.

🛠 Developer Action Steps:
Add a "Who Should Attend?" multi-select field to the event submission form.
Allow organizers to choose from:
✅ Family (All ages, kid-friendly)
✅ Parents (Parents & kids, but not fully family-focused)
✅ Adults (18+) (General adult audience)
✅ 21+ (Bars, alcohol-related events)
✅ Singles (Networking, dating, social)
✅ Professionals (Business & career events)
✅ Seniors (55+) (Retiree-friendly activities)
Ensure selected categories appear on event pages.
🔹 3. Add Event View Counter (Track Popularity & Increase Engagement)
📌 Users should be able to see how many times an event has been viewed.

🛠 Developer Action Steps:
Add a "Views" counter on each event listing & event detail page.
Every time a user visits an event page, increment the counter in the database.
Display:
"Viewed 1,024 times" on event detail pages.
Smaller "👀 1204 views" label on event listing cards.
🔹 4. Improve the Fun Assistant Box & Add a New Section
✅ What Needs to Be Done:
📌 Add a "Learn More" button under the Fun Assistant description.
📌 Clicking the button smooth-scrolls to a new "How the Fun Assistant Works" section below.

🛠 Developer Action Steps:
Modify the Fun Assistant Box:

Existing Text:
📌 Your Personal Fun Assistant
"Your AI-powered event assistant delivers personalized recommendations based on your interests—whether it's family fun, nightlife, or business networking."

Add a "Learn More" button under the description.
Create a New Section Below the Fold:
📌 H2 Title: "How the Fun Assistant Works"
📌 Subtext:

"Tell us what you love → Your Fun Assistant delivers top picks weekly!"
📌 How It Works (3-Step Process):

Choose Your Interests (Select Family, Singles, 21+, etc.)
Get Weekly Recommendations (Sent straight to your inbox!)
Adjust Anytime (Change your preferences anytime for better event matches!)
📌 Final Call-to-Action:

🎉 "Sign Up & Get Your Fun Assistant!"
(Button linking to user registration page)
🔹 5. Complete the "How the Fun Rating System Works" Section (From Previous Instructions)
🛠 Developer Action Steps:
Ensure the "Learn More" button in the Fun Rating box scrolls to this section.
Add the Fun Rating scale breakdown (1-5 stars, half-point increments allowed).
Include a visual representation (icons, progress bar, or grid layout).
Add an FAQ explaining:
Who assigns Fun Ratings?
Can ratings be adjusted?
What makes an event highly rated?
Add a CTA button encouraging event organizers to submit events.
