Question Recap

Should we add advertising to the site? Where could ads be placed?
What are the best practices for advertising based on ThurstonTalk’s example and our own site layout?
Should we create a dedicated advertising page and a homepage card that links to it?
What ad specs and packages do we offer?
Short Answer Example

“Looking at the ThurstonTalk example, I see a top banner and block ads throughout. For FunList.ai, we can do something similar but more structured and cohesive with our design. I propose:

A top banner ad space or ‘Featured Sponsor’ section beneath the hero for maximum visibility.
A ‘Local Partners’ or ‘Community Sponsors’ grid section near the bottom of the homepage.
A dedicated ‘Advertising’ page detailing packages, specs, and rates.
Before implementing, we should finalize:

Sponsorship tiers (e.g., Featured, Premium, Community).
Standard ad sizes and formats (e.g., 728×90, 300×250, PNG/JPG).
Placement in mobile vs. desktop views.
Integration with our admin dashboard for easy sponsor management.
Would you like me to mock up some examples or outline the technical steps needed to implement these ads on our Flask/Bootstrap stack?”

This concise reply addresses the immediate questions, shows you’ve looked at ThurstonTalk’s model, and suggests a plan without making any changes yet.

2. Advertising Packages (With Suggested Specs & Tiers)
Below is a sample set of sponsorship/advertising packages you might offer. You can customize the naming, pricing, and details based on your local market and audience.

Featured Sponsor

Placement: Top banner on the homepage (beneath hero section) or a prominent rotating banner.
Size: 728×90 (desktop) and 320×50 (mobile) – both IAB-standard sizes.
Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF.
Visibility:
High-visibility location on the homepage.
Option to appear on event listing pages or near the event map if desired.
Additional Perks:
Logo included in a “Featured Sponsors” area in newsletters.
Mention in monthly marketing emails.
Premium Partner

Placement: Sidebar or inline block ads on the homepage and/or event details pages.
Size: 300×250 or 300×600 (desktop); 320×50 or 300×250 (mobile).
Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF.
Visibility:
Visible in the main content area or sidebar, ensuring good exposure.
Additional Perks:
Inclusion in a “Local Partners” grid near the footer.
Optional sponsor highlight in a rotating carousel.
Community Sponsor

Placement: “Local Partners” grid near the bottom of the homepage or on a dedicated sponsors page.
Size: Typically smaller logos, e.g., 150×75 or 200×100.
Format: PNG, JPG, or SVG (for crisp scaling).
Visibility:
Showcases sponsor logos in a grouped format.
Link to sponsor’s website or a sponsor detail page.
Additional Perks:
Mention in a sponsor directory page.
Potential discount if they also host events on FunList.ai.
Technical Considerations

Store sponsor/ad metadata in your PostgreSQL database (e.g., ad name, file path/URL, sponsor tier, active/inactive status).
Use your admin dashboard (Flask-Admin or a custom Flask-Login-protected area) to upload images, set start/end dates, and manage sponsor tiers.
3. Creating the Advertising Page
3.1. Page Structure
Route & Template

Route: @app.route("/advertising")
Template: advertising.html
Content Sections

Hero/Intro:
A brief explanation of why advertising on FunList.ai is beneficial (audience, reach, local focus).
Advertising Packages:
Detailed info on each tier: Featured, Premium, Community.
Include images or placeholder banners for visual reference.
Pricing (monthly or weekly rates), duration, and specs (dimensions, file formats, etc.).
Ad Placement Previews:
Mockups or screenshots showing exactly where ads will appear on desktop vs. mobile.
Call to Action:
A simple form or “Contact Us” button for potential sponsors to inquire about purchasing ad space.
If you have an online payment or sign-up system, link to that.
Implementation Tips

Use Bootstrap components (cards, grids, modals) to structure your layout.
For the sponsor form, use Flask-WTF to handle form submissions.
Consider adding a “sponsorship inquiry” email that goes through Flask-Mail.
3.2. Linking From the Homepage
Card on the Homepage

Add a new card (Card 3 in your conversation) titled “Advertising” or “Promote Your Business.”
Keep the design consistent with the other two cards (Fun Rating System and List Your Event).
A simple CTA button: “Learn More” → links to /advertising.
Optionally include a small graphic or icon that aligns with your site’s color scheme.
4. Recommended Sizes & Formats (Desktop & Mobile)
Ad Placement	Desktop Size	Mobile Size	Format
Top Banner	728×90 or 970×90	320×50	PNG/JPG/GIF
Sidebar / Inline Block	300×250 or 300×600	300×250 or 320×50	PNG/JPG/GIF
Sponsor Grid Logos	200×100	200×100 (auto-scale)	PNG/JPG/SVG
Max File Size: ~150 KB recommended for quick load.
Resolution: 72 DPI is typical for web images.
Formats:
PNG/JPG for static ads.
GIF if you want minimal animation.
SVG for logos in sponsor grids (sharp scaling on all devices).
5. Technical Integration Details
Database (PostgreSQL + SQLAlchemy)

Create a Sponsors or Advertisements table with fields like:
id: Primary key
tier: String (Featured, Premium, Community)
image_url: String (path to static folder or a CDN)
start_date / end_date: Date fields for ad scheduling
status: Boolean or enum to indicate if the ad is active
link_url: Where the ad redirects on click
Admin Dashboard

A form to upload sponsor images, set tier, status, start/end dates, and link URL.
A simple data table to view/edit active ads.
For image uploads, you can store the files in static/uploads/ads or use a cloud storage service.
Flask Templates

Homepage Template:
Insert Jinja2 conditionals or loops to display active ads from the database.
For example, a “featured_ad” block at the top or a “local_partners” section near the bottom.
Advertising Page (advertising.html):
Display static information about the packages.
Optionally dynamically list sample ads if you want to show real data from your database.
Responsive Design (Bootstrap)

Use Bootstrap’s grid system (.col-lg-*, .col-md-*, .col-sm-*) to handle different breakpoints.
For top banner ads, consider using a responsive container that swaps out 728×90 for 320×50 on smaller screens.
Security & Performance

CSRF is already covered with Flask-WTF for forms.
Keep images compressed to avoid performance lags.
Implement caching or a CDN if you expect high traffic for sponsor images.
6. Putting It All Together
Answer the Conversation:

Confirm you’ll create a top-level “Advertising” page.
Suggest the placement of ads (Featured, Premium, Community).
Reassure that you’ll maintain a cohesive design that doesn’t clutter the user experience.
Design the Advertising Page:

Use a hero section explaining the value of advertising on FunList.ai.
Lay out each package with bullet points on specs, pricing, and benefits.
Add a “Contact Us” or “Buy Now” CTA that triggers a form or sends an email.
Add a Homepage Card:

Title: “Promote Your Business” or “Advertising”
Subtitle: “Reach thousands of local event-goers”
CTA Button: “Learn More” → /advertising
Implement in Phases:

Phase 1: Static layout and placeholders for ads.
Phase 2: Database integration + admin management.
Phase 3: Sponsor sign-up flow + payment integration (if applicable).

Final Summary
Yes, add an “Advertising” card on the homepage that links to a dedicated /advertising page.
Offer clear, tiered packages (Featured, Premium, Community) with well-defined specs and placements.
In the dedicated advertising page, detail the benefits, specs, pricing, and how sponsors can get started.
Use your Flask + Bootstrap stack to manage ad uploads, scheduling, and display logic.
Keep it simple at first (Phase 1 with static placeholders), then iterate (Phase 2 & 3) as you integrate a sponsor management system in your admin dashboard.
This approach will give you a structured way to introduce advertising without overwhelming users and while maintaining a professional, cohesive look and feel.
