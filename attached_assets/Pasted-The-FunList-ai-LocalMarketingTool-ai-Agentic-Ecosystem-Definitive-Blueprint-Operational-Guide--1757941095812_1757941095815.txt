The FunList.ai & LocalMarketingTool.ai Agentic Ecosystem: Definitive Blueprint & Operational Guide (v10.0 - Ultimate Comprehensive Compilation)
Document Purpose: This document is the single, ultimate, canonical source of truth for the FunList.ai event discovery platform and the LocalMarketingTool.ai (LMT) advertising marketplace. It synthesizes all strategic discussions, architectural decisions, operational workflows, data schemas (including the FunList.ai - Master Taxonomy & Schema.xlsx - Help me create the Master Taxon.csv), agent configurations, legal frameworks (including Terms of Use for LocalMarketingTool.ai), technical specifications, and all supporting materials (like Sheets_EventData_Functions.md, Anatomy of a FunList.ai Social Media Post, Optimizing Duplicate Check Logic, Typical Workflows Relevant to AMA/FunList/LMT, FunList System Design: Enhanced Data Acquisition, Validation, and Communication Framework, and all linked Google Docs/Sheets) from our entire collaborative process into one cohesive and exhaustive master plan. This document supersedes all previous versions and is intended to guide all phases of development, operations, and strategic evolution.

Part 0: Strategic Vision & Architectural Philosophy
(Synthesized from Architecting FunList.ai's Enhanced Event Ecosystem, FunList System Design: Enhanced Data Acquisition, Validation, and Communication Framework, user prompts, and the Business Glossary for “Prompt Creator” Gemini Gem)
A. Strategic Vision:
FunList.ai: To be the premier, most reliable, comprehensive, and engaging aggregator and curator of local community events in target regions (starting with Thurston County, WA, and built for rapid expansion to Pierce, King, Snohomish, etc.). Its core mission is to help users discover enjoyable and relevant experiences, significantly enhanced by its unique, persona-based "Fun Rating" system (drawing criteria from the FunList Qualitative Rating Adjustments sheet).
LocalMarketingTool.ai (LMT): To function as a dynamic, trusted, and efficient two-sided marketplace. It will be the primary public platform connecting "Sellers" (event organizers, venues, local businesses with advertising inventory – drawing from sources like Master List of Places to Advertise) with "Buyers" (local businesses seeking targeted hyperlocal promotion). LMT will integrate AI functionalities like the Buyer Agent and Seller Agent (which includes the AI Sponsorship Packager) to facilitate seamless search, discovery, and transaction initiation, governed by the Terms of Use for LocalMarketingTool.ai.
American Marketing Alliance SPC (AMA): The Washington State Social Purpose Corporation (as defined in the Business Glossary) developing and overseeing this localized marketing ecosystem. AMA serves as the primary platform and member interface, facilitated through local chapters, providing members access to the AI Agent Suite.
Synergy & Ecosystem Value: FunList.ai acts as a powerful lead generation and content engine for LMT.ai. The system discovers and validates events for FunList.ai, then proactively invites organizers (using specific Email Templates) to list and monetize their event-associated advertising and sponsorship opportunities via LMT.ai (populating the Advertising_Opportunities_List and RFP_Opportunities_List from the linked Google Form). This creates a self-reinforcing data and commercial flywheel.
Core Value Proposition: To become an indispensable resource for community members (event discovery tailored by Target Markets & Customer Personas documents), event organizers (event promotion and monetization), and local businesses (targeted advertising), thereby fostering greater local engagement and economic activity.
Central AMA Database/API: This is the foundational data repository and the primary source of truth, storing all event, advertising, sponsorship, user, entity (venue, organization defined in Master Taxonomy & Schema), and vendor data. It enables the critical "enter once, distribute everywhere" paradigm across the AMA network.
B. Architectural Philosophy:
Cloud-Native & Microservices (GCP): The system is architected as a series of specialized AI agents ("Gems") built as independently deployable microservices on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
Google Cloud First & Full Ecosystem Integration: Deeply leverages GCP for AI/ML (Vertex AI, Gemini), scalable data tools (Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Firestore), serverless infrastructure (Cloud Run, Cloud Functions), Google Workspace APIs (Gmail, Calendar, Sheets, Drive), and comprehensive DevOps tooling.
Automation & Intelligence: The system prioritizes automating every possible step of the data pipeline. AI, specifically Large Language Models like Gemini, is used for complex natural language understanding, classification (against the Master Taxonomy & Schema), data extraction (from websites, emails, images/screenshots with OCR), content generation, decision-making, and image analysis.
Ethical, Legal & Compliant Operations: Strict adherence to data sourcing ethics (guided by AMA - Data Sourcing & Ethics Guidelines), robots.txt directives, website Terms of Service (ToS), and data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA) is paramount. This includes a proactive, multi-step permission-seeking workflow and meticulous handling of Personally Identifiable Information (PII).
Modularity & Scalability for Regional Expansion: The entire system is designed with templated configurations and modular components to allow for rapid and efficient expansion to new geographical regions.

Part 2: The Information Architecture (The System's "Brain")
(Integrating the FunList.ai - Master Taxonomy & Schema.xlsx - Help me create the Master Taxon.csv, List of Information Sets for Gems, database schema from FunList System Design, and references to supporting documents like Ad_Types_List, Master List of Places to Advertise, Club Types, Team Types, Master List of Event Types, and various Persona documents)
2.1. The Master Taxonomy & Schema: The Central Entity Directory
This is the "Rosetta Stone" providing a unified structure for classifying all non-event entities (Venues, Places, Organizations, Categories, Attributes, Audiences, Personas). It is the primary reference for AI Gems.
Purpose: To create a single, highly-structured record or a set of interrelated tables defining every key entity and label, detailing types, sub-types, attributes, amenities, typical events, associated audiences, and keywords for AI. This allows for hyper-specific filtering and a deep contextual understanding by the system.
Core Schema (based on the user-provided FunList.ai - Master Taxonomy & Schema.xlsx - Help me create the Master Taxon.csv which serves as the definitive source for these fields):
Identification & Naming: Entity_ID (PK), Entity_Name, Alternate_Names, Acronyms.
Hierarchical Typing: Primary_Type (e.g., Business, Place, Organization, Event Category, Ad Type, Persona), Secondary_Type (e.g., Venue, Park, Non-Profit, Music Event, Banner Ad, Family Fun Seeker), Tertiary_Type (e.g., Restaurant, Bar/Pub, Stadium, Festival, Billboard, Active Senior), Quaternary_Type (more specific, if needed).
Descriptive Details: Description, Long_Description, Keywords, Tags.
Location Specific (for Places/Venues): Street_Address, City, State, Zip_Code, County, Country, Latitude, Longitude, Neighborhood, Service_Area_Radius.
Operational Details (for Places/Venues/Organizations): Website_URL, Contact_Email, Phone_Number, Social_Media_Handles (JSONB: {facebook, instagram, X, etc.}), Hours_of_Operation (JSONB), Year_Established.
Entity Relationships & Associations: Parent_Entity_ID (for hierarchies like Place -> Sub-Space), Associated_Event_Type_IDs (FKs to event type labels in this taxonomy), Associated_Audience_Segment_IDs (FKs), Associated_Persona_IDs (FKs), Associated_Amenity_Feature_IDs (FKs), Affiliated_Organization_IDs (FKs).
Features & Attributes: Amenity_Features (multi-select list, e.g., Pool Table, Stage, Patio, Playground, Serves Food, Wheelchair Accessible, Pet-Friendly), Attribute_Keywords (general descriptive attributes).
Business/Organizational Attributes: Organization_Type (Non-Profit, For-Profit, Governmental, Community Group, Club, Team - drawing from Club Types and Team Types sheets), Industry_Classification (NAICS/SIC if applicable).
Event Hosting Capabilities (for Venues/Places): Event_Types_Hosted_SuitedFor (list), Max_Capacity, Has_Rental_Space (Boolean), Rental_Contact_Info.
System Metadata: Date_Added, Last_Updated, Source_of_Record, Verification_Status.
Hierarchical Places (Place -> Sub-Space): A core concept. A Place (e.g., "O'Blarney's Irish Pub") can have multiple Sub-Spaces ("Main Bar," "Dining Room," "Patio"), each a distinct record in the Master Taxonomy & Schema linked via Parent_Entity_ID, and each having its own specific Age_Restriction, Capacity, and Amenity_Features.
2.2. Core Operational Database Schema (Cloud SQL - PostgreSQL)
Table: Entities (The Master Taxonomy & Schema operational instance)
All fields from section 2.1 will be columns in this master table or related normalized tables (e.g., a separate Amenities table linked by Entity_ID and Amenity_ID if Amenity_Features becomes very extensive). This is the central repository.
Table: Events (Master_Events_List)
EventID (PK), Name, Standardized_Description, Raw_Description, StartDate, EndDate, Price, AgeLimits, TicketURL, Primary_Venue_EntityID (FK to Entities), Primary_SubSpace_EntityID (FK to Entities, nullable), Primary_Organizer_EntityID (FK to Entities).
Metadata: Canonical_Source_URL, SourceURLs_Array (JSONB: {url, priority_score, source_name, reliability_score}), SourceType (e.g., 'Website', 'Newsletter', 'Partner', 'Manual'), TCCheckDate_Source, TCStatus_Source (Allowed, Prohibited, Unknown, etc.), PermissionStatus_Source (NotRequired, Requested, Granted, Denied, etc.).
Processing & Classification: ValidationDate, ValidatorID, AIConfidenceScore, Primary_Event_Category_EntityID (FK to Entities), Is_Sales_Promotion (Boolean), Is_Public_Event (Boolean), List_of_Extracted_Features_FunList (Array/JSONB), Associated_Event_Type_EntityIDs (Array FKs to Entities), Associated_Attribute_EntityIDs (Array FKs to Entities), Associated_Audience_Segment_EntityIDs (Array FKs to Entities).
Platform Specific: FunRating_[AudienceType] (multiple numeric columns, e.g., FunRating_Families, FunRating_Adults21Plus), Broad_Appeal_FunList (Boolean), Is_FunList_Qualified (Boolean), Is_BusinessCalendar_Candidate (Boolean), BusinessValueRating_BCal (Future).
Integration IDs: FunList_Calendar_Event_ID, FunList_Email_Draft_ID.
Status_FunList_Processing, Date_Added_to_Master, Last_Updated_Master.
Table: SponsorshipInfo (for LMT.ai integration)

Part 3: The Master Operational Workflow (The System's "Assembly Line")
(Based on the detailed 40-step Multi-Agent AI Workflow: Event Processing Operational Plan, integrating logic from FunList System Design, Optimizing Duplicate Check Logic, and Typical Workflows Relevant to AMA/FunList/LMT)
Phase 1: Scope & Source Discovery (Steps 1-8): Defines geographical scope, relevant event types (using Master List of Event Types), generates/refines search keywords. Discovers sources, consolidates, and de-duplicates against Known_Event_Sources_Venues.


Phase 2: Source Vetting & Compliance (Steps 9-15): T&C Compliance Agent (AI) checks robots.txt and uses Gemini to analyze ToS (guided by AMA - Data Sourcing & Ethics Guidelines), updating TCStatus in Known_Event_Sources_Venues. If restrictive, an automated Permission Request Workflow (using Email Templates from FunList System Design) is triggered by the Permission Request Agent (AI).


Phase 3: Event Data Extraction & Structuring (Steps 16-19):


Intelligent Web Scraping (Step 16): Scraping Agent (AI) uses Event Discovery Navigation Terms to find calendar pages. Extracts core event details as defined in the Master List of Events with Descriptions document. Captures SourceURL.
Email Newsletter Extraction (Step 17): Email Processing Agent (AI) uses Gmail API and Gemini.
Initial Validation, Cleaning & Geocoding (Steps 18-19): Validation Agent (AI) performs schema/format checks, text cleaning (applying logic from Sheets_EventData_Functions.md), and geocodes addresses.
Phase 4: Multi-Layered Validation & Enrichment (Steps 20-28):


AI Cross-Referencing & Fact-Checking (Step 20).
Advanced Duplicate Detection & Source Prioritization (Step 22 - per Optimizing Duplicate Check Logic): Implements Conditional Duplicate Check Logic ("First List" vs. "Subsequent List") using State Management and optimized strategies (e.g., Cached Subset Check). Designates Canonical_Source_URL based on Reliability_Score (e.g., RutledgeFamilyFarm.com preferred over ExperienceOlympia.com).
AI Entity & Event Classification & Enrichment (Step 23): Validation Agent (AI) uses Gemini and the Master Taxonomy & Schema to classify new entities and assign all relevant IDs (Event_Type_EntityIDs, Attribute_EntityIDs, Audience_Segment_EntityIDs, List_of_Extracted_Features_FunList) to events in Master_Events_List. Uses Event_Classification_Rules.
AI Social Media Handle Extraction (Step 24).
AI Confidence Scoring & Routing (Steps 21 & 25): Assigns confidence score. Routes events to automated approval, MTurk validation (using MTurk Validation Task Design Guidelines from FunList System Design), or internal human review (Human Validation Procedures from FunList System Design).
Human Validation (Steps 27-28).
Phase 5: Finalization & Storage (Steps 29-30): Data Structuring Agent (AI) formats records. Database Storage Agent (AI) commits to Cloud SQL.


Phase 6: Downstream Integration & Outreach (Steps 31-35): Outreach Agent (AI) sends email (using Event Organizer Notification Email template) to organizer, inviting them to list opportunities on LMT.ai (link passes EventID). LMT.ai confirms listing via API. A Sponsorship Assistance Workflow (per Typical Workflows) is triggered if organizer requests help.


Phase 7: Ongoing Monitoring & Maintenance (Steps 36-41): Periodic source re-checking, event update handling, AI agent performance monitoring, centralized logging, alerting.
