FunList.ai – Event Discovery & Sponsorship Platform (B2C with B2B elements)
Positioning: FunList.ai is a consumer-facing platform for discovering local events and experiences, powered by AI for personalized recommendations. It doubles as a platform where event organizers can list events and attract attendees (B2C) and connect with potential sponsors or advertisers (bridging to B2B). The copy should highlight the fun and convenience for the consumer, as well as the value for event organizers in terms of promotion. FunList.ai will maintain its own vibrant, community-centric brand identity. AMA’s influence appears only subtly (a footer note “Part of the AMA network”) and through behind-the-scenes functionality (like offering event organizers an easy path to LMT.ai for sponsorship deals). The ultimate funnel goal: get event organizers who use FunList to consider advertising their event or getting sponsorship via LMT.ai, and eventually engaging with AMA for broader marketing support.

FunList.ai Website Copy Outline
Homepage:

Hero Section:
Tagline: Something catchy and inviting, e.g., “Find Fun Faster – Your AI Guide to Local Events!” This immediately tells users FunList will help them find events and that AI is a differentiator (personalized suggestions).
Search/CTA: A prominent search bar or interactive AI prompt: “What would you like to do? [Ask FunList AI]” or “Search events near [Location].” Possibly a button CTA: “Discover Events Now” for users who prefer browsing.
Imagery: (If imagery were used, it would be vibrant local event photos, but since images are not in scope, focus on text and possibly colorful design elements that imply music, food, community gatherings, etc.)
Personalization Blurb: One sentence like “Tell our AI what you enjoy, and get tailored events just for you – from concerts and festivals to workshops and family fun.” This highlights the unique AI assistance aspect.
Featured Events/Sections: Show a few categories or personalized sections (if user is logged in, “Recommended for You”; if not, “Popular This Week in [City]”, “Upcoming Festivals”, etc.). Each category might have a short heading: “Trending in Seattle”, “Weekend Family Activities”, “Live Music Tonight” – enticing snippets to click through. The copy around these should remain light and exciting.
CTA for Organizers (Home sidebar or banner): A subtle yet visible invitation: “Hosting an event? List it on FunList for free and reach your local audience!” with a “List Your Event” button. This ensures organizers who land on the site know it’s for them too.
AI Assistant Promotion: If FunList.ai has a chat or interactive feature (which “personalized AI assistance” suggests), have a small callout: “🤖 Meet FLORA, your FunList AI – ask her to plan your weekend!” (Name the AI assistant for personality, if applicable). This encourages engagement and showcases innovation, aligning with current trends in event discovery where AI is becoming key​

Event Listings/Search Results Page:

If the user searches or clicks a category, the results page should have instructional copy up top: “Events in [Seattle]: Showing 25 events. Use filters for date, category, or ask FunList AI for a custom recommendation.”
Filters UI Text: Use friendly tone: e.g., filter labels like “When? (Date/Time)", "What kind of events? (Music, Food, Outdoors, etc.)", "Who’s it for? (Kids, Adults, Everyone)".
Each event listing might show a snippet – ensure the design includes an “Add to FunList” or “RSVP/Interested” button. If so, a line can invite: “Sign in to save events and get reminders!” prompting user account creation in a value-driven way (so they don’t miss events).
Sponsored Events Disclosure: If some events are promoted (via LMT.ai integration maybe), label them subtly as “Featured” or “Sponsored”. E.g., “Featured Event” tag on those entries. Transparency builds trust, and it’s also a hook for organizers to consider “How do I get my event featured?” (answer: through LMT’s advertising option, which we funnel them to).
Event Detail Page:

For each event page, copy should excite the user about the event and also provide clear calls to action:
Basic info (date, time, location, description) written in an enthusiastic tone if possible (pull from organizer’s input, but ensure template text around it is inviting: “Don’t miss out on…”).
AI Tip: A small AI-generated blurb like “This event matches your interest in live jazz!” if the user’s preferences indicate it – making the experience feel tailored.
Share CTA: “Share with friends” (if features allow) – encourages virality.
Call to Action: If tickets are needed, “Get Tickets” link (leading to external site or integrated ticketing). If it’s free or RSVP, “RSVP” or “Add to Calendar”. These are primary actions for users.
Organizer/Sponsor Section: At the bottom or side, a section: “Organized by [Org Name]”. Underneath, Sponsor This Event or “Interested in sponsoring or promoting this event?” link. This link would lead an interested sponsor or the organizer to the LMT.ai interface for sponsorship. For instance, clicking “Sponsor this event” could funnel a business user to LMT’s page for that event’s sponsorship listing. If the user is the organizer viewing their own event, this might instead say “Promote your event to more people” – also linking to LMT’s ad options.
Footer Branding: As with other pages, include “Powered by FunList.ai – An AMA Network Service” in small text at the bottom. This is another soft reminder of the ecosystem link, in line with the endorsed brand strategy.
List Your Event Page (for Organizers):

Pitch to Organizers: “Reach thousands of local event-goers – for free! Listing your event on FunList.ai is the easiest way to get discovered.” Emphasize that it’s fast, free, and smart (with AI making sure the right people see it). Perhaps mention: “Our AI will recommend your event to users who are likely to love it.” This assures organizers of the platform’s value.
Steps to List: Outline how simple it is: (1) Create a free account, (2) Enter event details, (3) Publish and share. If possible, mention a moderation or quality check by FunList for trust (e.g., “We review submissions to ensure quality events for our community”).
Upgrade/Promotion Option: After highlighting the free listing, introduce a gentle upsell: “Need extra visibility? Feature your event.” Explain that for added reach, they can promote the event to appear at top of listings or in users’ feeds (this likely ties into LMT.ai advertising mechanism). But do not call it LMT here; just call it “Featured Event option.” If the organizer clicks to feature, behind the scenes it goes to LMT’s flow for purchasing a sponsored placement on FunList.
CTA: “List My Event Now” – bright and enticing. Possibly also a secondary CTA: “Learn About Event Promotion” which then educates about sponsorship/featured listing (and leads to LMT.ai info).
About FunList.ai Page:

What It Is: “FunList.ai is your personalized guide to what’s happening around you. We combine local know-how with AI smarts to help people discover events they love and help organizers connect with enthusiastic audiences.” Keep the tone upbeat and community-oriented.
Why It Exists: Mention the challenge it solves: “Ever feel like you hear about an event after it’s over? FunList ensures you never miss out. By learning your interests and keeping an eye on all local happenings, our AI curates a fun list just for you.”
AMA Network Mention: “FunList.ai is part of the American Marketing Alliance’s local engagement network. (one sentence) Our mission is to strengthen community connections – whether through marketing or memorable experiences.” This ties the purpose back to AMA’s overarching mission without delving deep.
Community Focus: If applicable, mention community guidelines or how they ensure events are genuine. Possibly highlight partnerships with local city guides or AMA chapters (e.g., “AMA local chapters often host events you’ll see featured here – come out and network!”).
CTA: “Start Exploring Events” to drive users back into using the platform. If an organizer is reading, a small mention of “Join as Organizer” could be here too.
FunList.ai Sales Copy & Funnel Considerations
For Consumers (B2C angle):

“Discover Your Next Adventure: From neighborhood festivals to tech meetups, FunList.ai finds events tailored to you. No more endless scrolling on generic event sites – our AI learns what you like and brings you the fun.”*
Emphasize the ease and personalization: “Think of FunList as your friendly local insider. Just ask, and get recommendations that fit your mood – whether it’s a family outing or a solo night out.”
Social proof could be subtle, e.g., “Join thousands of locals who’ve found their weekend plans with FunList.ai.”
CTA (User-focused): “Find Events Near You”, “Get Personalized Event Picks”. These could be used in digital ads or app store descriptions if FunList.ai is also a mobile app. They highlight the benefit (events near you, personalized picks) to entice downloads or usage.
For Event Organizers & Sponsors (B2B angle within FunList):

“Get Your Event Noticed: FunList.ai connects your event with the people most likely to attend. List your event for free and let our AI match it with interested locals. It’s event marketing on autopilot.”*
Highlight the sponsorship angle: “Looking for sponsors or partners? When you list on FunList, you’re also tapping into a network of local businesses via our sister platform – making sponsorship connections a breeze.” This hints at LMT.ai integration without needing the reader to know the technical details.
A statistic if available or relevant: “According to industry data, 80% of event organizers rely on social and local channels for promotion. FunList combines both, plus AI – giving you an edge in reaching your audience.” (Placeholder stat – if none, emphasize the concept: AI + local reach = better turnout.)
CTA (Organizer-focused): “List Your Event – Free”, “Boost Event Visibility Now”. The second CTA could specifically target those ready to advertise (which leads into LMT’s paid options).
Also consider an email or onboarding copy for organizers: after listing an event, send an email like “Your event is live! Tip: Boost your event to reach 3x more locals – learn more [link].” This is sales copy that gently nudges them to consider paid promotion (the link goes to LMT.ai’s sponsorship listing for their event).
Tone: For consumers, keep it enthusiastic and friendly. For organizers, encouraging and solution-oriented (they often struggle to get the word out; we offer a solution). Always maintain a helpful tone rather than hard sell – e.g., “We’re here to help your event succeed.”

FunList.ai UX & Integration Points
User-Friendly Design: The FunList interface should be visually engaging (bright colors, maybe playful illustrations or icons) and very easy to use. People should be able to find events with minimal typing – hence the importance of the AI assistant and good categorization. The design should invite exploration (infinite scroll of events or a map view) without feeling overwhelming.
AI Chat/Assistant: If there’s an AI chat feature, ensure the UI encourages using it (maybe a chat bubble “Ask me for recommendations!”). This differentiator should be prominent because it’s a unique selling point.
Performance & Mobile: Likely many will use FunList on mobile while out and about. Make sure the site (or app) is lightweight and quick. If it’s a web app, implement good caching for event images and use geolocation (with permission) to auto-show local events immediately.
Cross-Platform Navigation: Integrate links between FunList and LMT in non-intrusive ways. For example: when an organizer is managing their event on FunList, a button “Find Sponsors” can lead them to LMT.ai with that event pre-filled in a sponsorship listing form – a seamless handoff. Conversely, if a business on LMT sees an event sponsorship opportunity, they could click to view the event details on FunList (to understand the event context) – so ensure that deep links work and the user can easily get back. Using consistent page layouts and perhaps a shared header element (like a thin AMA bar or simply the AMA logo in a corner that when clicked offers a menu of the three platforms) could be considered to smooth navigation, but only if it doesn’t clutter the UI.
Account Integration: Ideally, a user account on FunList (for organizers) could be tied to an AMA/LMT account. Single sign-on here would mean an organizer uses one login for FunList (listing events) and LMT (managing ad sponsorships). This is a behind-the-scenes feature but has copy implications (e.g., on sign-up: “Use your AMA account to log in” or “Sign up with email” options). If SSO is too complex initially, at least ensure that after an organizer lists an event, if they click “Promote event”, they are guided through creating an LMT account as smoothly as possible (prefill whatever info was already given).
Minimal Overlap in Branding: Apart from the footer mention of AMA, keep FunList’s UI focused on events and community. For instance, avoid showing LMT or AMA logos in the main navigation of FunList. The user’s primary goal is either find events or manage their event; any AMA ecosystem hints should stay in footers or dedicated info sections as described. This avoids confusion and upholds each brand’s standalone integrity.
Feedback Loop: Implement ratings or feedback for events attended and for the AI recommendations (“Was this suggestion helpful?”). This engages users and also provides testimonials that could be used in copy later (“95% of users say FunList’s AI saved them time finding events!” – a potential claim to use once data supports it).
