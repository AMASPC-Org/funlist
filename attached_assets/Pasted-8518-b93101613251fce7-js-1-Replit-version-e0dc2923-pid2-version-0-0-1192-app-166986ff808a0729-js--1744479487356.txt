Funlistai-v2:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <button.css-1pmdxvm#react-aria2846281588-:r3nh:>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div#__next> <div id=​"__next">​…​</div>​
