Question Recap

Should we add advertising to the site? Where could ads be placed?
What are the best practices for advertising based on ThurstonTalk’s example and our own site layout?
Should we create a dedicated advertising page and a homepage card that links to it?
What ad specs and packages do we offer?
Short Answer Example

“Looking at the ThurstonTalk example, I see a top banner and block ads throughout. For FunList.ai, we can do something similar but more structured and cohesive with our design. I propose:

A top banner ad space or ‘Featured Sponsor’ section beneath the hero for maximum visibility.
A ‘Local Partners’ or ‘Community Sponsors’ grid section near the bottom of the homepage.
A dedicated ‘Advertising’ page detailing packages, specs, and rates.
Before implementing, we should finalize:

Sponsorship tiers (e.g., Featured, Premium, Community).
Standard ad sizes and formats (e.g., 728×90, 300×250, PNG/JPG).
Placement in mobile vs. desktop views.
Integration with our admin dashboard for easy sponsor management.
Would you like me to mock up some examples or outline the technical steps needed to implement these ads on our Flask/Bootstrap stack?”

2. Advertising Packages (With Suggested Specs & Tiers)
Below is a sample set of sponsorship/advertising packages you might offer. You can customize the naming, pricing, and details based on your local market and audience.

Featured Sponsor

Placement: Top banner on the homepage (beneath hero section) or a prominent rotating banner.
Size: 728×90 (desktop) and 320×50 (mobile) – both IAB-standard sizes.
Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF.
Visibility:
High-visibility location on the homepage.
Option to appear on event listing pages or near the event map if desired.
Additional Perks:
Logo included in a “Featured Sponsors” area in newsletters.
Mention in monthly marketing emails.
Premium Partner

Placement: Sidebar or inline block ads on the homepage and/or event details pages.
Size: 300×250 or 300×600 (desktop); 320×50 or 300×250 (mobile).
Format: PNG, JPG, or GIF.
Visibility:
Visible in the main content area or sidebar, ensuring good exposure.
Additional Perks:
Inclusion in a “Local Partners” grid near the footer.
Optional sponsor highlight in a rotating carousel.
Community Sponsor

Placement: “Local Partners” grid near the bottom of the homepage or on a dedicated sponsors page.
Size: Typically smaller logos, e.g., 150×75 or 200×100.
Format: PNG, JPG, or SVG (for crisp scaling).
Visibility:
Showcases sponsor logos in a grouped format.
Link to sponsor’s website or a sponsor detail page.
Additional Perks:
Mention in a sponsor directory page.
Potential discount if they also host events on FunList.ai.
Technical Considerations

Store sponsor/ad metadata in your PostgreSQL database (e.g., ad name, file path/URL, sponsor tier, active/inactive status).
Use your admin dashboard (Flask-Admin or a custom Flask-Login-protected area) to upload images, set start/end dates, and manage sponsor tiers.
3. Creating the Advertising Page
3.1. Page Structure
Route & Template

Route: @app.route("/advertising")
Template: advertising.html
Content Sections

Hero/Intro:
A brief explanation of why advertising on FunList.ai is beneficial (audience, reach, local focus).
Advertising Packages:
Detailed info on each tier: Featured, Premium, Community.
Include images or placeholder banners for visual reference.
Pricing (monthly or weekly rates), duration, and specs (dimensions, file formats, etc.).
Ad Placement Previews:
Mockups or screenshots showing exactly where ads will appear on desktop vs. mobile.
Call to Action:
A simple form or “Contact Us” button for potential sponsors to inquire about purchasing ad space.
If you have an online payment or sign-up system, link to that.
Implementation Tips

Use Bootstrap components (cards, grids, modals) to structure your layout.
For the sponsor form, use Flask-WTF to handle form submissions.
Consider adding a “sponsorship inquiry” email that goes through Flask-Mail.
3.2. Linking From the Homepage
Card on the Homepage

Add a new card (Card 3 in your conversation) titled “Advertising” or “Promote Your Business.”
Keep the design consistent with the other two cards (Fun Rating System and List Your Event).
A simple CTA button: “Learn More” → links to /advertising.
Optionally include a small graphic or icon that aligns with your site’s color scheme.
