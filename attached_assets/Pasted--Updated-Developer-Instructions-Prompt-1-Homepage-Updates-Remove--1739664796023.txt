### **Updated Developer Instructions (Prompt)**  

📌 **1. Homepage (`/`) Updates**  
- **Remove the event map from the homepage** (the map belongs on `/map`).  
- **Hero Section:**
  - **Headline:** “Discover the Best Events in [Your Area] with FunList.ai”  
  - **Subtext:** "Sign up to get handpicked, high-rated events delivered weekly!"  
  - **Call-to-Action Button:** “🔔 Get My Weekly FunList” → Leads to email sign-up form.  
- **Add an "Explore Events" button**  
  - A toggle for **Map View (`/map`) vs. List View (`/events`)**  
  - Button text should dynamically adjust based on the current view.  
- **Add an "About FunList.ai" Section** explaining:  
  - What makes FunList.ai unique (AI-driven event curation, Fun Rating system).  
  - How Fun Ratings work.  
  - How event personalization works via the Fun Assistant.

📌 **2. Event Pages (`/map` and `/events`) Updates**  
- **Ensure `/map` and `/events` remain separate pages** (avoid AJAX toggles).  
- **"Switch View" Button:**  
  - On **`/map`**, add a button labeled **"📋 Switch to List View"** → Links to `/events`.  
  - On **`/events`**, add a button labeled **"📍 Switch to Map View"** → Links to `/map`.  
  - Place the button at the **top right** of the page.  
  - On **mobile**, use a **floating button (FAB)** for easy access.  
- **Ensure SEO-friendly canonical tags** are correctly implemented.

📌 **3. Implement the Fun Score System (1-5 Scale, Half-Point Increments Allowed)**  
- **Rename "Fun Rating" to "Fun Score"** (after verifying trademark availability).  
- **Adopt a 1-5 rating scale** with half-point increments (e.g., 3.5, 4.5).  
- **Fun Score logic:**  
  - Scores are determined based on **number & variety of activities** an event offers.  
  - Example mapping (already outlined for Adult, Family, Singles, Business, etc.).  
- **Display the Fun Score prominently on event listings & detail pages.**

  - Ensure event submissions are saved correctly in the database.  
  - Redirect paid promotions to **LocalMarketingTool.ai** for advertising, sponsorship, & vendor opportunities.  
- **Event Categorization:**
  - Ensure events can be tagged based on **audience preferences** (e.g., Family, Adult, Senior, Single).  
  - Users should be able to filter events based on these tags in `/map` and `/events`.

📌 **5. User Sign-Up & Personalized Event Curation**  
- **Ensure users can sign up and select event interests (e.g., Family, Singles, Business).**  
- **Enable Fun Assistant (Later Integration)**
  - Not required immediately, but ensure user preferences are stored in the database.  
  - These preferences should later be used for **personalized event recommendations**.

📌 **6. Admin Dashboard & Database Fixes**  
- **Ensure database correctly saves:**  
  - Users & their event preferences.  
  - Event submissions with all metadata (Fun Score, categories, etc.).  
- **Fix any remaining AttributeErrors in admin routes & templates.**  
- **Ensure `/admin/login` works correctly** with:  
  - Email: `ryan@funlist.ai`
