Subject: Overhaul Signup Form for Clear Role Definition
Request:
Please redesign the user signup form (signup.html) and its corresponding form class (forms.py) and route logic (routes.py) to clearly capture the user's primary role/intent upon registration. This will replace the current ambiguous checkbox section and defer preference collection to improve user experience and support tailored onboarding later.
Tasks:
Modify forms.py:
Locate the SignupForm (or RegisterForm, based on your previous file).
Remove the following fields:
event_focus (Checkboxes: Single, Professional, Adult, etc.)
preferred_locations (StringField)
event_interests (StringField)
is_event_creator (BooleanField)
is_vendor (BooleanField)
vendor_type (SelectField - this will move to the vendor profile edit)
Add a new required field:
primary_role (RadioField, Label: "What is your primary reason for joining FunList.ai?", validators=[DataRequired()]). Set the choices as follows:
choices=[
    ('attendee', 'Find events to attend'),
    ('organizer', 'Create, list, or promote events'),
    ('venue', 'Represent an organization or venue that hosts events'),
    ('vendor', 'Offer services for events (e.g., catering, AV, entertainment)'),
    ('sponsor', 'Explore advertising or sponsorship opportunities')
]
Use code with caution.
Python
Keep email, password, confirm_password, and terms_accepted fields.
Modify Signup Template (templates/auth/signup.html - Verify Path):
Remove Sections: Delete the entire "Your Preferences" section, including the "Tell Us About Yourself", "Preferred Locations", and "Event Interests" fields and their associated HTML.
Remove Checkbox Section: Delete the "I'm here to:" section with all its checkboxes (find_events, is_event_creator, is_vendor, represent_organization).
Add Radio Button Section: Add a new section to render the primary_role RadioField. Ensure it's clearly labeled and user-friendly. Example structure:
<div class="mb-3">
    {{ form.primary_role.label(class="form-label") }}
    {% for subfield in form.primary_role %}
    <div class="form-check">
        {{ subfield(class="form-check-input") }}
        {{ subfield.label(class="form-check-label") }}
    </div>
    {% endfor %}
    {% if form.primary_role.errors %}
        <div class="invalid-feedback d-block">
             {% for error in form.primary_role.errors %}
                <span>{{ error }}</span>
             {% endfor %}
        </div>
    {% endif %}
</div>
Use code with caution.
Html
Keep the Email, Password, Confirm Password, Terms Acceptance, and Submit button rendering.
Modify Signup Route Logic (routes.py - signup function):
Remove Preference/Old Role Logic: Delete any code within the if form.validate_on_submit(): block that attempts to process or save data from the removed fields (event_focus, preferred_locations, event_interests, is_event_creator, is_vendor, etc.).
Process primary_role: Get the selected value from form.primary_role.data.
Map Role to User Booleans: Based on the selected primary_role, set the corresponding boolean fields on the user object before db.session.add(user):
Set user.is_subscriber = True (Always True for new signups).
If form.primary_role.data == 'organizer': Set user.is_organizer = True AND user.is_event_creator = True.
If form.primary_role.data == 'venue': Set user.is_organizer = True (representing the venue itself), potentially also user.is_event_creator = True.
If form.primary_role.data == 'vendor': Set user.is_vendor = True.
If form.primary_role.data == 'sponsor': Consider if you have an is_sponsor boolean or similar. If not, you might not need to set a specific flag here, or you could set is_sponsor = True if that model field exists. (Self-correction: is_sponsor was part of the User model previously, let's assume it exists). Set user.is_sponsor = True.
If form.primary_role.data == 'attendee': No additional flags needed beyond is_subscriber.
Keep Core Logic: Retain the logic for checking existing users, setting email/password, setting account_active, adding the user to the session, committing, flashing messages, and redirecting.
Onboarding Flag: Keep session['new_registration'] = True as this will trigger the (future) onboarding wizard.
Provide Complete Code: Return the complete, fully edited code for the following files:
forms.py
templates/auth/signup.html (or specific path)
routes.py
Context:
The goal is to simplify signup and clearly identify the user's primary purpose.
Detailed preference collection is deferred to post-signup.
The selected primary role will determine the initial user experience and which profile fields are relevant later.
Please implement these changes carefully, ensuring the form, template, and route logic are consistent.
