Funlistai-v2:1 Blocked aria-hidden on an element because its descendant retained focus. The focus must not be hidden from assistive technology users. Avoid using aria-hidden on a focused element or its ancestor. Consider using the inert attribute instead, which will also prevent focus. For more details, see the aria-hidden section of the WAI-ARIA specification at https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-hidden.
Element with focus: <div.cm-content cm-lineWrapping>
Ancestor with aria-hidden: <div. useView_view__C2mnv css-1gdmsm6 Surface_surfaceDefault__TcNI5> <div class=​" useView_view__C2mnv css-1gdmsm6 Surface_surfaceDefault__TcNI5" aria-hidden=​"true" style=​"--useView--gap:​ 4px;​ --borderColor:​ var(--outline-dimmer)​;​ --focusedBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​ --hoverBorderColor:​ var(--accent-primary-default)​;​">​…​</div>​flex
