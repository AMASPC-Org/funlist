Font Recommendations (Website-Wide):

Given the content and the desire for a clean, modern, and engaging feel, here's a refined approach:

1. Headings (H1, H2, H3):

Poppins (Recommended): As mentioned earlier, Poppins offers a strong, geometric sans-serif style that's perfect for headings. It creates a clear hierarchy and adds a touch of modern energy.
Montserrat (Alternative): A slightly less bold but equally modern choice. It's clean, versatile, and works well for headings.
Raleway (Alternative): Offers a bit more elegance and sophistication while still maintaining a modern feel.
2. Subheadings/Section Titles:

Montserrat (Recommended): Provides a good balance between the boldness of the headings and the lightness of the body text.
Nunito Sans (Alternative): A friendly and approachable option that can create a softer feel.
Lato (Alternative): A clean and readable choice that works well for subheadings.
3. Body Text:

Lato (Strongly Recommended): Lato is a highly readable and versatile sans-serif that's perfect for body text. It's clean, friendly, and works well at various sizes.
Open Sans (Alternative): A classic and reliable choice for body text. It's known for its excellent readability.
Nunito Sans (Alternative): Can create a slightly more casual and approachable feel.
4. Button Text:

Montserrat Bold (Recommended): Using a bold version of Montserrat for your button text will make them stand out and draw attention.
Poppins Medium/SemiBold (Alternative): Can provide a slightly more energetic feel.
Lato Bold (Alternative): A safe and reliable option for button text.
Font Pairing Considerations:

Headings (Poppins/Montserrat/Raleway) + Body Text (Lato/Open Sans/Nunito Sans): This creates a clear visual hierarchy and ensures readability.
Subheadings (Montserrat/Nunito Sans/Lato) + Body Text (Lato/Open Sans/Nunito Sans): Maintains consistency while providing a slight variation in weight or style.
Implementation Tips:

Use Consistent Font Weights: Establish a clear hierarchy using different font weights (e.g., regular, medium, bold).
Maintain Consistent Spacing and Line Height: Proper spacing and line height will improve readability and visual appeal.
Test on Different Devices: Ensure the font looks good and is readable on various screen sizes.
Consider Font Loading Performance: Choose web-optimized fonts and load them efficiently to avoid slowing down your website.
