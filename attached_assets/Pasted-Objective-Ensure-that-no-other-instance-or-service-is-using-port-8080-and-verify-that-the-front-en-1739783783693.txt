Objective:
Ensure that no other instance or service is using port 8080, and verify that the front-end (including any Webview configuration) correctly points to the active server port—with proper CORS/network settings—to resolve loading issues.

Instructions:

Port Availability and Conflict Resolution

Check for Port 8080 Usage:
Update the app.py file to perform a check using a socket (as currently implemented) to detect if port 8080 is already in use.
If port 8080 is occupied, log an appropriate message (e.g., "Port 8080 is already in use") and automatically switch to an alternate port (e.g., 8081).
Ensure that if any other instance of the application is running, it is either shut down or the conflict is handled gracefully by switching ports.
Instructions for Developers:
Include clear logging messages so that during startup, it is evident which port the server is binding to.
Optionally, add a note or script that developers can run locally to list processes using port 8080 (e.g., using lsof -i :8080 on Unix-based systems) to aid debugging.
Webview and Front-End Configuration

Verify API/Webview Endpoint:
Ensure that any front-end code (JavaScript, HTML, or Webview configuration) references the correct port number that the Flask server is using.
If the front-end is hard-coded to use port 8080, update it to dynamically use the correct port (based on an environment variable or configuration setting) or to match the one chosen at runtime.
CORS and Network Settings:
Check that CORS headers are properly configured in your Flask app (consider adding Flask-CORS if necessary) so that cross-origin requests from the Webview are allowed.
Verify that there are no network/firewall issues on Replit that might block connections to the chosen port.
Test that API calls from the Webview successfully reach the backend and that responses are properly received.
Testing and Validation

Local Testing:
Run the application in your Replit workspace and observe the logs to ensure that the port-check logic correctly identifies if port 8080 is in use and switches to an alternative if needed.
Webview Testing:
Confirm that the Webview correctly points to the active server port.
Test for any CORS errors or network issues in the browser’s console and address them accordingly.
Documentation:
Update any relevant documentation (or comments in the code) to describe the new behavior regarding port selection and Webview configuration.
Please implement these changes and thoroughly test the application in Replit to confirm that:

No conflicting process is using port 8080 (or that the conflict is resolved automatically).
The server correctly starts on the intended port.
The front-end/Webview is configured to connect to the correct port with no CORS or network issues.
