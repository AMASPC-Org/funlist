Final Prompt for Replit AI Agent
High-Level Objective
Create a responsive, unified navigation bar that adjusts based on:
Mobile vs. Desktop screens
Logged-In vs. Logged-Out user state
Admin vs. Non-Admin user roles
1. Common Nav Elements (All Pages)
FunList.ai Text/Logo in the Middle (Mobile Only)
On mobile, center the “FunList.ai” text or logo in the nav bar.
On desktop, place it in a standard position (e.g., top-left) or wherever your current design has it.
Hamburger Menu (Left)
On mobile, show a hamburger icon (<i class="bi bi-list"></i> or similar) on the left side.
Tapping the hamburger reveals a dropdown or collapsible menu containing links to:
Events (goes to /events)
Map (goes to /map)
On desktop, these links can be part of a standard horizontal nav or remain behind a hamburger if desired. (Typically, desktop nav is expanded, but you may keep a hamburger if that suits your design.)
Logged-Out vs. Logged-In (Right Side)
Logged-Out Users (Mobile):
Show “Sign In” and “Sign Up” (text links or buttons) on the right side of the nav bar.
No person icon, because the user isn’t authenticated.
Logged-Out Users (Desktop):
Similar approach: “Sign In” and “Sign Up” on the right side, or wherever they currently reside in your desktop design.
Logged-In Users (Mobile):
Hide “Sign In / Sign Up.”
Display a person icon (<i class="bi bi-person"></i>) on the right side. This icon opens a dropdown with user-specific links (see below).
Logged-In Users (Desktop):
A person icon or “Profile” text (depending on your preference) on the right side. The dropdown is also accessible here.
2. Person Icon Dropdown (Logged-In Users Only)
Default User Links (All Logged-In Users)
Edit Profile
My Events (events the user posted via “Add Event”)
Saved Events (bookmarked/favorited events)
Admin-Only Links (Conditionally Visible)
Event Management
User Management
Analytics
Shown only if current_user.is_admin (or equivalent role check).
Logout (If applicable)
Optionally include a “Logout” link in this dropdown if that’s your standard approach.
3. Layout & Spacing Fixes
No Overlap on Any Page
Compare your homepage, /events, /map, admin pages, profile pages, etc.
Ensure consistent use of Bootstrap classes (.navbar, .container, .mt-4, etc.) so the nav bar never overlaps page content.
Check the top margin/padding so the main content starts below the nav bar.
Responsive Classes
Use Bootstrap’s built-in classes like d-none d-md-block (desktop only) or d-md-none (mobile only) if you need to show/hide elements in different breakpoints.
Or rely on the official navbar-toggler / collapse pattern for a single nav bar that transitions smoothly between mobile and desktop.
4. Implementation Tips
Partial Template
Place the nav bar in a single partial (e.g., templates/partials/navbar.html) if using Flask + Jinja2. Include it in every page template so changes propagate site-wide.
Conditional Logic
Logged-In vs. Logged-Out:
jinja
Copy
{% if current_user.is_authenticated %}
  <!-- Show person icon, hide Sign In / Sign Up -->
{% else %}
  <!-- Show Sign In / Sign Up, hide person icon -->
{% endif %}
Admin vs. Non-Admin:
jinja
Copy
{% if current_user.is_authenticated and current_user.is_admin %}
  <!-- Admin links in the dropdown -->
{% endif %}
Mobile Centered Title
Use .text-center or a Bootstrap utility class to center the “FunList.ai” text/logo on mobile.
Hide or reposition it on desktop as needed.
5. Testing & Validation
Device Testing
Mobile: iOS, Android—ensure the hamburger on the left, “FunList.ai” in the middle, person icon or sign in/up on the right, no overlap.
Desktop: Confirm the standard layout is intact, with no overlap, and all dropdowns function properly.
User Roles
Admin: Sees “Event Management,” “User Management,” “Analytics” in the dropdown.
Non-Admin: Sees only “Edit Profile,” “My Events,” “Saved Events.”
Logged-Out: Sees “Sign In” and “Sign Up,” but no person icon or admin links.
No Overlapping
Check every page template to confirm the nav bar is properly spaced from the content below it.
Action
Please implement the above instructions in Replit, ensuring that:

The nav bar is responsive for mobile vs. desktop.
Hamburger (left) + FunList.ai (middle) + Person Icon or Sign In/Up (right) appear correctly on mobile.
Desktop layout remains consistent with no overlap or spacing issues.
Admin links appear only for admin users, while all logged-in users see “My Events,” “Saved Events,” and “Edit Profile.”
Logged-out users see “Sign In / Sign Up” instead of the person icon.
After implementing, thoroughly test each scenario (mobile vs. desktop, logged in vs. logged out, admin vs. non-admin) across all site pages to confirm a flawless, unified user experience.
