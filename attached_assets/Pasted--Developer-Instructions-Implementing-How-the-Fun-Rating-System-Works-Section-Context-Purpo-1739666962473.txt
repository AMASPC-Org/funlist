📌 H2 Title: "How the Fun Rating System Works"
Every event is rated on a 1-5 scale, with half-point precision, based on its activities, engagement level, and attendee experience.
More attractions = a higher rating!

📌 Visual Breakdown (Add a Horizontal Fun Rating Scale)
📌 Example of a simple fun-rating visualization (icons or a progress bar-like layout)

⭐	⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐⭐	⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐
Basic Event	2+ Attractions	Interactive	Multiple Activities	Full-Scale Experience
Example Ratings & What They Mean:
✔️ ⭐ (1.0 - 1.5) → Single feature event (e.g., live music, fireworks show)
✔️ ⭐⭐ (2.0 - 2.5) → Two+ combined attractions (e.g., live music + car show)
✔️ ⭐⭐⭐ (3.0 - 3.5) → Interactive elements (e.g., beer garden, food tasting, contests)
✔️ ⭐⭐⭐⭐ (4.0 - 4.5) → Large multi-experience event (e.g., music, VIP, entertainment zones)
✔️ ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ (5.0) → Full-scale event (e.g., music, VIP, fireworks, multiple attractions)

📌 Implementation Notes:

This can be displayed as a slider, progress bar, or grid for better UX.
Add fun icons to make it more visually engaging.
