Prompt for Replit AI Agent: Update the About Page
Task: Apply the following UX and development improvements to enhance readability, engagement, and functionality while keeping the title size unchanged.

Changes to Make
User Experience (UX) Improvements:
Improve CTA Buttons:

Update "Post an Event" to "Host an Event – Get Discovered!"
Update "Subscribe to Weekly FunList" to "Get Weekly Fun Alerts!" with a small subtext: "No spam—just the best local events!"
Add hover effects to both buttons for better interaction.
Increase Readability & Visual Appeal:

Add whitespace between sections for better readability.
Introduce subtle dividers to separate content blocks clearly.
Keep the current title size but add a subheading below it, such as:
"Your go-to guide for discovering and promoting fun events in Thurston County!"
Add Visual Enhancements:

Include small icons next to "Post an Event" (📅) and "Subscribe" (📩) to make them more eye-catching.
Consider using a soft gradient background behind the CTA section for better contrast.
Optimize Subscription Box UI:

Replace the plain email input with a rounded field that has placeholder text: "Enter your email to stay in the loop..."
Add a checkbox for users to personalize updates based on interests (e.g., 🎵 Music, 🍽 Food, 🎭 Arts).
CTO & Full-Stack Development Improvements:
Optimize CTA Button Tracking:

Implement event tracking for CTA clicks via Google Analytics or Mixpanel.
A/B test different button placements and text for better conversions.
Enhance Subscription Flow:

Convert the "Subscribe" button into a modal pop-up that triggers after 10 seconds of user inactivity.
Integrate Google & Facebook OAuth signups for quick subscriptions.
Performance & Accessibility Fixes:

Ensure all buttons and links have ARIA labels for screen reader compatibility.
Use lazy loading for any images to improve page speed.
Final Steps for Implementation:
✅ Update UI elements based on the above improvements.
✅ Implement tracking and A/B testing for CTA buttons.
✅ Optimize performance and accessibility for a seamless experience.

After completing changes, perform a usability test to measure engagement and refine further based on feedback. 🚀
