funlist.ai is the B2C "Town Square" of the AMA Digital Metropolis. It attracts a consumer audience, which generates engagement data and identifies event organizers. This data directly feeds the B2B LocalMarketingTool.ai (LMT.ai) platform, where organizers become sellers, creating the "Data Flywheel" that is the core of AMA's business model. The Personal Fun Assistant agent is a key differentiator for the user experience and must be treated as a mission-critical component.

Rules for processing events submitted via screenshot or image

One of the steps is to look for the host website and the venue website if it is different than the host.

Then the next step is to find them social media

So as part of that, the agent will first need to figure out if it’s a new venue or host.
	If it is then search for website and socials
	If it isn’t then refer to the master list of venues and organizers

All that to say that we are timestamping the event and giving a disclaimor that the event is subject to change or be canclled and to check website and socials for the latest updates.

For every event or activity look for RSVP Requirment, whether you have to purchase tickets ahead of time, if you have to purchase the tickets at the event when it happens, etc….

Then you need to find the url where the tickets can be purchased or rsvp can be made etc…

So basically, I am thinking maybe we need a special instructions section for each event/activity.
	What are things that go in special instructions?
		Parking specifics
		Wheelchair or handicap access
		Cash Only or Credit Card only
Also

Is this a public event or private event?
Is membership required?


The host can also be considered the event organizer.

Not all activities are events but all events have activities
