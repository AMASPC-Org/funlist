Act as the CTO / Lead Developer for this current Replit project.
Your Task:
Analyze the current state of this project's codebase, directory structure, configuration files (replit.nix, requirements.txt/poetry.lock, etc.), Replit settings (Secrets usage, Deployment configuration if inferable), and overall architecture. Based on this analysis, generate a comprehensive Technical Report and Analysis intended for an external IT consulting firm.
Purpose of the Report:
To provide the external consultants with a detailed and accurate snapshot of the project's technical foundations, current status, architecture, state management practices, and key challenges, enabling them to quickly understand the context and scope for potential engagement.
Required Sections & Content:
Your generated output must include the following sections, drawing information directly from analyzing this project:
Technical Report:
Technology Stack: List the specific languages, frameworks, libraries, databases (Replit DB or other), and platform services identified in use.
Project Architecture & Directory Structure: Describe the overall layout, how backend and frontend components interact (or fail to), and the location of key assets (HTML, CSS, JS, templates, static files). Note any inconsistencies (e.g., mixed static/templated approaches).
State Management: Detail how application state is currently handled. Specifically address:
Authentication Status (Logged In vs. Logged Out)
User Roles/Types (Admin vs. User, Free Member vs. Paid Member - based on evidence in code/DB interactions)
Cookie Consent state (if applicable).
Note where this logic resides (backend sessions, frontend storage, templating engine?).


Deployment & Infrastructure (Replit Context): Describe how the project is deployed (Static, Web Service?), use of Replit DB, Secrets, and environment configuration (replit.nix).
Known Issues & Challenges: Summarize key problems observed in the code or structure. Critically, include the issues related to hardcoded navigation links, lack of conditional link rendering based on user state, and the resulting maintenance problems. Mention other potential issues like code duplication, lack of testing, etc.
Current Status: Briefly describe the operational state (e.g., in development, partially functional, deployed with bugs).


Expanded Analysis (Consultant's Perspective):
Go beyond just listing facts. Provide a brief CTO-level analysis.
What are the immediate architectural concerns (e.g., maintainability, scalability risks)?
What areas likely need the most urgent attention from the consultants (e.g., navigation refactoring, consistent state handling)?
Are there potential security, testing, or code quality red flags an external consultant should be aware of based on your analysis?


Format and Guidance (Crucial):
Use the following example report structure and level of detail as a model and template for the report you generate. Adapt the content based on your analysis of this actual project, but adhere to the structure, section headings, and type of information presented in the example below.
