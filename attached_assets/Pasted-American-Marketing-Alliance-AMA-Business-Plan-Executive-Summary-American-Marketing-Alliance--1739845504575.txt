American Marketing Alliance (AMA) Business Plan

Executive Summary

American Marketing Alliance SPC (AMA) is a Washington-based Social Purpose Corporation (SPC) dedicated to transforming local marketing through AI-driven automation. AMA owns and operates LocalMarketingTool.ai (LMT.ai) and FunList.ai, two integrated platforms designed to optimize hyper-local advertising, sponsorships, and event discovery.

AMA’s mission is to help businesses, nonprofits, and media organizations engage effectively with their target audiences while democratizing AI-powered marketing for small and mid-sized businesses. Through LMT.ai, businesses can efficiently discover and book advertising opportunities, while FunList.ai enhances local engagement by curating AI-driven event discovery.

The local advertising market is projected to reach $171 billion by 2025, with businesses increasingly shifting toward digital and hyper-local campaigns to maximize return on investment (ROI). AMA’s AI-driven advertising marketplace and event discovery platform remove inefficiencies, creating a seamless, highly scalable, and profitable marketing ecosystem. The transaction-based revenue model ensures sellers maintain control over their own listings, while AMA generates revenue through facilitation fees. Additionally, AMA leverages its technology to identify emerging sponsorship trends, offering new revenue channels for businesses and event organizers.

Rather than positioning for an exit, AMA is structured as a long-term, highly profitable investment vehicle with a self-sustaining revenue model and decentralized operational approach. The company will scale organically through strategic partnerships, licensing agreements, and AI-driven efficiency, without reliance on venture capital or acquisition. AMA’s ultimate goal is to reach a $1B valuation while maintaining full ownership, solidifying its position as the first billion-dollar solopreneur-led enterprise.

As AMA scales, a Chief Operating Officer (COO) will be brought in to manage operations and drive national expansion. Recognizing that founders can sometimes slow the growth of their companies, AMA is implementing a structured plan to transition leadership while ensuring the technology, relationships, and business model remain intact. The COO will oversee full expansion into California and national growth while maintaining AMA’s unique decentralized structure.

Market Analysis

Industry Overview

The U.S. local advertising industry is experiencing a digital transformation, with businesses prioritizing AI-driven solutions to refine ad targeting and reduce wasted spend. As businesses seek more data-driven decision-making tools, AMA’s model is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. The growing demand for automation in advertising placement and sponsorship selection further underscores the necessity for AMA’s AI-driven ecosystem.

Market Moat & Proprietary Data Strategy

One of AMA’s strongest competitive advantages is its proprietary local advertising and sponsorship data. Unlike many AI companies that scrape publicly available data, AMA’s local event sponsorship opportunities, venue advertising listings, and hyper-local promotions are not online anywhere else.

Centralized Data Hub: AMA serves as the Multiple Listing Service (MLS) for local advertising, providing the only structured, AI-enhanced repository of local sponsorship and ad placement opportunities.

Strategic Partnerships: Chambers of commerce, Economic Development Councils (EDCs), and nonprofit organizations such as United Way do not want to deal with multiple fragmented platforms. AMA consolidates their opportunities into one centralized solution, making it the default go-to for local sponsorships and advertising.

API & Data Licensing: As AMA’s exclusive local sponsorship and ad data becomes more valuable, companies will want to scrape and analyze it. AMA will prevent unauthorized data extraction while offering API access via a tokenized licensing model, ensuring long-term revenue generation from AI and data-driven businesses.
