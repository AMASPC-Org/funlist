I need your help to identify and fix several critical issues in a Next.js web application, primarily related to memory leaks and asynchronous operation errors.  I have provided console output below that highlights the problems. I'll also provide relevant code snippets as needed.

--- Console Output Ends ---

**Priorities (in order):**

1. **Fix Event Listener Memory Leaks:**
   The console output shows a *very large* number of `MaxListenersExceededWarning` warnings, indicating a serious memory leak.  These warnings list various event types, such as `commitComplete`, `fileDirty`, `fileClean`, `commitStart`, `promptUserReconnect`, `cursor`, `removeCursor`, `fileSavedChanged`, `error`, `fsError`, `transparentReconnect`, and `changes`.  This strongly suggests that event listeners are being added repeatedly without being removed.  This is the *highest priority* issue.

   * **Action:** Find *all* instances in the codebase where `addEventListener`, `.on()`, `.addListener`, or any other event listener attachment methods are used.  For *each* instance, ensure there is a corresponding `removeEventListener` (or the equivalent method for the specific event emitter) that is called when the component unmounts or when the listener is no longer needed.
   * **Focus:** Pay *very close* attention to `useEffect` hooks in React components. The cleanup function within `useEffect` is the correct place to remove listeners.
     *   **Good Example:**
        ```javascript
        useEffect(() => {
          const handleResize = () => { /* ... */ };
          window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
          return () => { // This is the cleanup function
            window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
          };
        }, []); // Empty dependency array means this effect only runs on mount/unmount
        ```
     * **Bad Example (Missing Cleanup):**
       ```javascript
         useEffect(() => {
           window.addEventListener('resize', () => { /* ... */ });
           // MISSING:  No cleanup function to remove the listener!
         });
       ```
     * **Bad Example (Incorrect/Missing Dependency Array):**
       ```javascript
        useEffect(() => {
          const handleClick = () => { console.log('click'); };
          document.addEventListener("click", handleClick); 
          //Missing return
        }); // Missing dependency array - this will add a NEW listener on EVERY render!
        ```
        * **Bad Example (Missing return statement):**
         ```javascript
        useEffect(() => {
         const handleResize = () => {
           console.log("Window resized!");
            };
         window.addEventListener("resize", handleResize);
        }); // The empty array [] means this effect only runs on mount and unmount
          ```

   * **Refactor:** If anonymous functions are used as event listeners, refactor the code to use *named* functions.  This is *essential* for being able to remove the listener later.
   *   **Suggestion:**  If the application uses a custom event emitter (not just DOM events), consider creating a utility function or a custom React hook to manage adding and removing listeners to that emitter, to centralize the cleanup logic and avoid repetition.

2. **Fix `Uncaught (in promise)` Errors:**

   The console output shows a very large number of `Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received` errors. This indicates problems with how asynchronous operations (Promises) are being handled.

   * **Action:** Examine *all* asynchronous code (Promises, `async/await`, `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, WebSocket interactions).
     *   Ensure that every `.then()` has a corresponding `.catch()` block to handle rejections.  *Every* promise chain *must* handle potential errors.
     *   If using `async/await`, ensure that `try...catch` blocks are used correctly to handle errors within the `async` function.
     *   If a component that initiates an asynchronous operation might be unmounted *before* the operation completes, make sure to handle this case gracefully.  This often involves using a flag (e.g., `isMounted`) to track whether the component is still mounted, and only updating state if it is.  Or, use an AbortController to cancel the request.
     *   Pay close attention to WebSocket interactions.  Ensure connections are properly closed when no longer needed, and that event listeners for WebSocket events (`open`, `message`, `close`, `error`) are correctly managed.

3.  **Fix `Invalid href` Routing Errors:**

    The following error is repeated many times in the console:
    `Invalid href 'https://bb2afc4e-e780-47cf-9519-605ec6fb181c-00-g6uexhd3hcj5.janeway.replit.dev:3001//...' passed to next/router in page: '/replEnvironmentDesktop'. Repeated forward-slashes (//) or backslashes \ are not valid in the href.`
    * The error message is always within the context of, '_app-114e34e9b5e9e10c.js'.
    *   **Action:**  Review the code in `_app-114e34e9b5e9e10c.js`, or whichever file provides routing (likely a custom `_app.js` or a routing configuration file in a Next.js project).  Identify where URLs are being generated with double slashes (`//`).  Correct the URL generation logic to produce valid URLs.  This likely involves fixing string concatenation or template literal usage.
    * **Pay close attention to routes using dynamic parameters.**  This is a common place for errors like this to occur. Make sure you are handling cases where a parameter might be `null`, `undefined`, or an empty string.  Use a helper function to construct URLs if necessary, to ensure consistency.
    *Example:
       //Bad Code, might generate "//"
        const path = `/${basePath}/${segment}`;

       // Better code: (example using a simple helper).
        function buildPath(...parts) {
            return parts.filter(Boolean).join('/'); //Remove empty parts, join with single /
        }

        const path = buildPath(basePath, segment);
    *

4.  **Investigate and Resolve Network Errors:**

    The console output shows several network-related errors:

    *   `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED`:  This indicates a DNS resolution problem.  The browser cannot find the server's IP address.  Verify that the domains used in your application (especially those related to API endpoints like `graphql` and logging services like `logs.browser-intake-us5-datadoghq.com`) are correctly configured and resolvable.  This might involve checking DNS settings on the Replit server or ensuring that the necessary services are running and accessible.
    *   `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 401 (Unauthorized)`:  These errors indicate authentication failures.  Review the authentication/authorization logic in your application and on the server.  Make sure user sessions are being managed correctly and that API requests include the necessary credentials.
    *   `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED`:  This suggests network interruptions.  While you can't directly control network stability, you can make your application more resilient by implementing retry mechanisms for network requests and handling connection errors gracefully.
        *  `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 404 ()`:  Indicates a missing asset.
       *  `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 500 (Internal Server Error)`: This should be fixed by addressing backend problems with the server
      * `Failed to load resource: the server responded with a status of 429 (Too Many Requests)`:  Indicates client-side logic for handling request is needed.

5. **Address remaining errors:**
  *  Find where `TermsModal` is being called in the file provided and make sure it is imported and declared correctly.
  * Address the TypeError by ensuring all variables are defined and have value before trying to use them.

6.  **Address remaining warnings (lower priority, but still important):**

    *   **`Unrecognized feature: '...'`:**  These warnings indicate the use of experimental or unsupported browser features.  Review these and consider using alternative, more widely supported APIs if possible.
    *   **`Allow attribute will take precedence over '...'`:**  This is a minor issue, but review the usage of `<iframe>` attributes to ensure they are correct.
    *   **`Blocked aria-hidden on an element...`:** Fix the accessibility issue by removing `aria-hidden` from focusable elements or their ancestors. Use the `inert` attribute instead, as suggested.
    *   **`<meta name="apple-mobile-web-app-capable" content="yes"> is deprecated...`**:  Update the meta tag to use the recommended `mobile-web-app-capable`.
    * **`Error while parsing the 'sandbox' attribute...`:** Correct the sandbox attribute in the relevant iframe.
    * `WARN: A component changed from uncontrolled to controlled.` and vice-versa, fix these issues.
    * **`stallwart: failed ping ...` / `stallwart: session stalled`:**  Investigate the `stallwart` library/service and its configuration.  This might be related to the WebSocket and network issues.
    * **WebGL Warnings:** Address the WebGL warnings by following the suggestion and using `--enable-unsafe-swiftshader`.

7. **Address third-party Cookie Warning:** Investigate use of third-party cookies and ensure compliance.

**Providing Files:**

Yes, providing relevant files would be *extremely* helpful.  Since I can't directly access your Replit files, you'll need to copy and paste the code into our conversation.  Focus on these files first, as they are most likely to contain the source of the problems:

1.  **Any files related to routing:** In a Next.js project, this would likely be files in the `pages` directory, especially `_app.js` or `_app.tsx` (if you have a custom App component), and any files that define routes or use the `useRouter` hook or `<Link>` component. Look for places where URLs are being constructed.
2.  **Components that use `useEffect`:** These are prime suspects for event listener leaks. Share the *full* code of these components, including imports.
3.  **Components that interact with WebSockets:**  If you have any components that establish WebSocket connections, share their code.
4.  **Code related to authentication/authorization:** If you have custom code for handling user login, session management, or API authentication, sharing that would be helpful.
5.  **Any code related to "stallwart":** If you're using a library or service called "stallwart," provide the code that configures and uses it.
6.  **Any files mentioned in the stack traces of the errors:**  The console output often includes file names and line numbers (e.g., `RegisterForm.tsx:605`).  These are *very* important clues.  Provide those files.
7. **`package.json`:** This file lists your project's dependencies.  Sharing this will allow me to see which libraries you're using, which can help identify potential sources of problems (e.g., if a library is known to have memory leak issues).

When you paste the code, please format it as a code block (using triple backticks ```) for readability.  Also, clearly indicate the file name and (if applicable) the specific function or component within the file. The more context you provide, the better I can assist you.

**Example of how to provide a code snippet:**
Use code with caution.
Here's the code from components/MyComponent.js:

import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function MyComponent() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setCount((prevCount) => prevCount + 1);
    }, 1000);

    // Example cleanup function - GOOD!
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, []); // Empty dependency array

  return (
    <div>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
