🔹 What’s Causing This?
📌 The error occurs at line 310 inside an anonymous function attached to HTMLDocument.
📌 This likely happens when the script tries to use events before it has been defined or fetched.
📌 Possible reasons:
✅ events is missing from an API response (fetch failed or returned undefined).
✅ events is not declared in the script before it's used.
✅ The script is running before the events data is available.

🔹 How to Fix It
✅ 1. Check if events is Declared Properly
Find where events is supposed to be defined.
Look for something like:

javascript
Copy
Edit
console.log(events); // ❌ If this prints "undefined", events is not loaded correctly
If events is supposed to come from an API, make sure it is assigned properly:

javascript
Copy
Edit
fetch('/api/events')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
        console.log(data); // ✅ Check if data is valid
        events = data; // ❌ If 'let events;' was never declared, this will fail
    })
    .catch(error => console.error("Error loading events:", error));
✅ 2. Ensure events is Declared in the Right Scope
If events is missing, declare it at the top of the script:

javascript
Copy
Edit
let events = []; // ✅ Declare it globally
✅ 3. Make Sure the Script Runs After the Page Loads
If events is accessed before it's available, delay execution:

javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    fetch('/api/events')
        .then(response => response.json())
        .then(data => {
            events = data;
            console.log("Events loaded:", events);
            addMarkers(events); // ✅ Now we are sure events exists
        })
        .catch(error => console.error("Error loading events:", error));
});
🔹 Developer Fix Instructions
✅ 1. Check if events is defined before using it.
✅ 2. Ensure events is properly declared (let events = [];).
✅ 3. If fetching from an API, handle missing data properly.
✅ 4. Make sure scripts run only after the page has fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded).

🚀 Why This Fix Works
✔️ Prevents accessing events before it's available.
✔️ Ensures events is always defined before use.
✔️ Catches API errors instead of breaking the page.
