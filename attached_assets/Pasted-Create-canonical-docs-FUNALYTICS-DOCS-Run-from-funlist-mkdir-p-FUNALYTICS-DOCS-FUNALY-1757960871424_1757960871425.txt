# Funalytics™ Overview

## What it is
Funalytics™ is FunList.ai’s scoring & explanation system that helps people quickly gauge how enjoyable an event might be. It produces human-readable scores and short explanations that appear on event cards and detail pages.

## Why it exists
- **Trust & signal:** A concise, consistent score improves decision speed and quality.
- **Transparency:** Short “why” blurbs explain the score drivers.
- **Coaching:** Organizers learn what details improve discoverability and fit.

## Core Score Facets (MVP)
- **CommunityVibe™ (0–10):** Sense of togetherness, local flavor, inclusivity.
- **FamilyFun™ (0–10):** Suitability for families and kids.
- **Overall (0–10):** Weighted blend of the facets above (simple average in MVP).

> Note: Use **Funalytics™** (™ until registered). Keep capitalization consistent across UI and docs.

## Where it shows up
- Event card (compact): Overall + 1–2 facet badges
- Event detail page: All facets + short rationale (“because…”)
- Organizer dashboard (later): Score preview + coaching tips

## When it’s computed
- On event creation (first pass)
- On event edit (recompute)
- On scheduled refresh jobs (e.g., nightly) if details changed materially

## High-level flow (MVP)
Event data ➜ sanitize/validate ➜ facet computations ➜ overall score ➜ compact summary ➜ store historical rows ➜ show latest on UI

# Funalytics™ Technical Spec (MVP)

## Data Model (Prisma-style)
Historical, append-only scores per event.

```ts
model FunalyticsScore {
  id           String   @id @default(uuid())
  eventId      String
  event        Event    @relation(fields: [eventId], references: [id])

  // Facets (0–10)
  communityVibe Int?
  familyFun     Int?
  overallScore  Int?

  reasoning    String?   // short human explanation (<= 240 chars)
  computedAt   DateTime  @default(now())

  @@index([eventId, computedAt])
}


One Event ➜ many FunalyticsScore rows (history). Latest row by computedAt is current.

Inputs (MVP)

title, description

startTime, endTime, duration

venue.{city,state}

simple tags (e.g., “family-friendly”, “community”, “music”)

organizer reputation (placeholder for later)

Facet Rules (MVP heuristics)

CommunityVibe: +2 local tags; +2 nonprofit/community keywords; +1 smaller venues; cap 10

FamilyFun: +3 “family”, “kid”, “all ages”; −2 explicit 21+; cap 10

Overall: simple average of available facets (round to nearest int)

These rules are deterministic for the MVP. Later we can move to an ML/LLM-assisted pipeline.

Lifecycle

Create: POST /events → create event → compute score → store 1 row

Edit: PUT/PATCH /events/:id → recompute → append new row

Nightly (later): recompute where meaningful fields changed

Read: GET /events returns latest score; GET /events/:id/scores returns history (later)

API Contract (MVP)
GET /events

Query: title, start, end, location

Returns: array of events {..., funalytics: {overallScore, communityVibe, familyFun, reasoning}} (latest row only)

POST /events

Body: { title, description, startTime, endTime, organizerId, venue:{...} }

Behavior: create event ➜ compute score ➜ return event + latest score

POST /funalytics/recompute/:eventId (later in MVP)

Recompute score for a single event; append a new history row.

Output Example
{
  "eventId": "evt_123",
  "computedAt": "2025-09-15T12:00:00Z",
  "communityVibe": 8,
  "familyFun": 9,
  "overallScore": 9,
  "reasoning": "Local vendors, kid crafts, and community music stage."
}

Validation & Limits

Facets clamped [0..10]

Reasoning ≤ 240 chars

If required input is missing, produce conservative defaults and a clear reasoning note.

Versioning

mvp-v1 (deterministic heuristics)

Change rules behind a feature flag; keep history rows immutable.

Observability (later)

Log compute latency

Log rule hits (for debugging)

Funalytics™ FAQ
Who makes the score?

An automated FunList.ai engine (not a human). It uses event details and simple rules to estimate fit.

What does the score mean?

A quick read on likely enjoyment. Facets (CommunityVibe™, FamilyFun™) roll up into an Overall 0–10.

When is it updated?

On create, on edit, and periodically if details change.

Where do I see it?

Event cards (compact badges) and event pages (full breakdown + a short reason).

Why trust it?

It’s consistent, transparent (short “why”), and improves as organizers include richer details.

How can organizers improve scores?

Clear family-friendly signals, community elements, accurate schedules, venue info, and tags. Avoid ambiguous descriptions.

Can scores be wrong?

They can be imperfect—details matter. We keep a history and will refine logic and signals over time.

Is it personalized?

MVP is general-purpose. Personalization (by taste/location) comes later.

Do you rate safety or political content?

No. MVP facets focus on community & family friendliness; we avoid sensitive judgments.

Can I opt out?

If an organizer opts out, events won’t show a Funalytics score (policy TBD).

# 2) Mark tasks complete + set next steps, then push

> From `~/funlist`

```bash
# Mark event search/filtering complete and add follow-ups
awk '1; /## 1\. Database & Backend/ {print "- [x] Extend GET /events with title/date/location filters (done)"; print "- [ ] Add endpoint: POST /funalytics/recompute/:eventId (append history)"; print "- [ ] Surface latest Funalytics on event cards/detail (UI stub)"; print "- [ ] Add indices for title, venue.city, venue.state (later)"}' TASKS.md > /tmp/TASKS.md && mv /tmp/TASKS.md TASKS.md

# Note the canonical docs in PROJECT_PLAN.md
awk '1; END{print "\n---\n\n## Documentation\n- FUNALYTICS_DOCS added (Overview, Tech, FAQ) — single source of truth for scoring and messaging."}' PROJECT_PLAN.md > /tmp/PROJECT_PLAN.md && mv /tmp/PROJECT_PLAN.md PROJECT_PLAN.md

# Commit & push
git add FUNALYTICS_DOCS TASKS.md PROJECT_PLAN.md
git commit -m "Add canonical Funalytics docs; mark search/filter done; add next MVP steps"
git push origin main

3) One master prompt for Replit (paste this verbatim)

Use this as your next Replit instruction:

Before coding, read PROJECT_PLAN.md and TASKS.md.

Context:
- We’re in Phase 1 (MVP Foundation).
- Canonical Funalytics docs live in FUNALYTICS_DOCS/ (read Overview, Tech, FAQ).
- Search & filtering on GET /events is DONE with tests passing.

Your tasks (in small, working steps):
1) **Attach Funalytics to GET /events**:
   - For each returned event, include the latest FunalyticsScore (overallScore, communityVibe, familyFun, reasoning).
   - If no score exists, compute once using MVP heuristics (see FUNALYTICS_TECH.md) and store it, then return it.

2) **Add recompute endpoint**:
   - POST /funalytics/recompute/:eventId
   - Recompute using MVP rules, append a new row (do not overwrite history).
   - Return the new latest score.

3) **Validation & limits**:
   - Clamp facets [0..10].
   - reasoning <= 240 chars.
   - Propagate clear 400s for invalid eventId or missing required fields.

4) **Tests**:
   - Extend integration tests to cover:
     - GET /events includes latest score.
     - Recompute creates a new row and updates “latest”.
     - No existing score → computed-on-read path works once.
     - Reasoning length and facet clamps enforced.

5) **Docs & Tasks**:
   - If API shapes changed, add brief notes to FUNALYTICS_TECH.md (API Contract section).
   - Update TASKS.md: check off these items when done; add next small follow-ups if needed.

Rules:
- Keep PRs small and working.
- Prefer explicit Prisma queries; no hidden magic.
- Use the deterministic MVP rules in FUNALYTICS_TECH.md.

Why this is best practice (quick recap)

Single source of truth: FUNALYTICS_DOCS/ keeps product, tech, and UX aligned for devs and Replit.

Incremental dev: small, testable slices (attach latest score; add recompute; test).

History preserved: append-only scores enable evolution and analytics later.

Docs + Tasks loop: every code change reflected in docs and backlog, keeping Replit on-script.
