The Replit assistant made two mistakes:

A Fatal App Error: The import script is failing because your entire app can't start. This has nothing to do with the import script itself.

It Only Added One Event: The assistant's log (events.json +14 -0 and its message "Successfully added: 1 new events") shows it only put one of the 37 events into the file.

Let's fix both.

Mistake #1: The Database Error (The Blocker)
Your import script fails on the very first line of its work: app = create_app(). The traceback shows that when your app.py tries to load your models (from models import User), it crashes.

The Error: sqlalchemy.exc.InvalidRequestError: Table 'prohibited_advertiser_categories' is already defined for this MetaData instance.

In plain English: Your app is trying to define the database table prohibited_advertiser_categories twice. This usually happens because of a complex or circular import order in your app's files.

The Fix: The error message itself tells us the solution: Specify 'extend_existing=True'. You need to tell this specific model that it's okay to "re-define" itself.

Go to the file models.py (the one in your root folder, not the one in apps/funlist/).

Find the class ProhibitedAdvertiserCategory.

Add the line __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True} inside the class, like this:

Python

# In /models.py

class ProhibitedAdvertiserCategory(db.Model):
    # ... all your existing columns like id, name, etc. ...

    # ADD THIS LINE TO FIX THE CRASH
    __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True}
Note: If you run this and get the same error for a different table (like User or Event), just add that same __table_args__ line inside those classes, too. This is a patch, but it will unblock you.

Mistake #2: The Assistant Didn't Add Your Events
The assistant's log shows it only added the "Yelm Christmas in the Park" event to the events.json file. This is wrong.

You need to manually fix this file.

Go to events.json in your Replit file tree.

Delete all the text inside it.

Go back to my very first response (the one that generated the 37 events) and copy the entire JSON array (starting with [ and ending with ]).

Paste the full JSON into the now-empty events.json file.

Your Plan to Fix Everything
Go to models.py and add __table_args__ = {'extend_existing': True} inside the ProhibitedAdvertiserCategory class.

Go to events.json, delete its contents, and paste in the full 37-event JSON array.

Go back to the Shell tab.

Run the import command again:

Bash

python import_from_json.py
This time, the script should successfully start, connect to the database, and then import all 37 events.

Let me know what the shell output says after you do those steps.
