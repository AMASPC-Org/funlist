🔹 Developer Instructions: Fixing Spacing & Layout for Fun Rating Section
📌 Issues Observed:
Uneven spacing between elements – The FAQ section feels cramped under the "Example Ratings."
Accordion spacing – The FAQ boxes are too close together, making it feel cluttered.
Spacing before "Planning an Event?" CTA – There's not enough separation, making it blend awkwardly.
✅ Fix 1: Increase Spacing Between Sections
📌 Add margin adjustments to create clear separation:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Add spacing between Example Ratings and FAQ */
.example-ratings {
    margin-bottom: 20px; /* Increase spacing */
}

/* Add spacing between each FAQ item */
.faq-item {
    margin-bottom: 10px; /* Increase spacing between questions */
}

/* Ensure Planning an Event? CTA has enough space */
.event-cta {
    margin-top: 30px; /* Creates a visual break */
}
✅ Fix 2: Adjust FAQ Accordion Padding for Better Readability
📌 Improve padding inside the accordion items to prevent tight spacing:

css
Copy
Edit
/* Adjust accordion items */
.accordion-item {
    padding: 12px 16px; /* Adds breathing room inside */
    margin-bottom: 10px; /* Spacing between items */
}
✅ Fix 3: Improve Flow & Balance
📌 Spacing Guide for Flow Improvement:
✅ Ensure at least 20-30px spacing between sections for visual balance.
✅ Make the "Planning an Event?" CTA distinct by adding a margin-top of 30px before it.
✅ Align text and button spacing properly to avoid stacking inconsistencies.
