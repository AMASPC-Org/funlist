I need help identifying and fixing potential memory leaks and performance issues in a web application built with Next.js and React.  The application is experiencing a large number of errors and warnings in the browser console, indicating problems with event listeners, asynchronous operations, and network requests. The attached text file contains a sample of the browser's developer console output.

**Primary Goals:**

1.  **Identify and fix memory leaks caused by unremoved event listeners:**
    *   The console output shows numerous `MaxListenersExceededWarning` messages. This *strongly* indicates that event listeners are being added but not removed.
    *   Focus on finding all instances of `addEventListener`, `.on()`, `.addListener`, or any other event listener attachment methods.  For *each* instance, ensure there is a corresponding `removeEventListener` (or equivalent) that is called when the component unmounts or the listener is no longer needed.
    *   Pay *particular* attention to code within `useEffect` hooks in React components.  The cleanup function within `useEffect` is the correct place to remove listeners.  Make sure the cleanup function is actually being called (use console logs or the debugger to verify).
        * Example of a GOOD `useEffect`:
          ```javascript
          useEffect(() => {
            const handler = () => { /* ... */ };
            window.addEventListener('resize', handler);
            return () => { // Cleanup function!
              window.removeEventListener('resize', handler);
            };
          }, []); // Empty dependency array = runs on mount and unmount
          ```
          Example of a BAD `useEffect` (missing cleanup):
          ```javascript
          useEffect(() => {
            window.addEventListener('resize', () => { /* ... */ });
            // MISSING CLEANUP!  This will leak memory.
          });
          ```
        * Example of a BAD useEffect (incorrect dependencies)
         ```javascript
            useEffect(() => {
                const handleClick = (event) => { console.log(event.clientX, event.clientY)}
                document.addEventListener("click", handleClick)
            })
        ```
    *   If anonymous functions are used as event listeners, refactor the code to use named functions so they can be properly removed.
    *   Consider using a utility function or custom hook to manage event listeners, ensuring automatic cleanup.
    * If event emitters are being used and there's an off() or removeListener() method, use it.

2.  **Fix `Uncaught (in promise)` Errors:**
    *   The console output shows a very large number of `Uncaught (in promise) Error: A listener indicated an asynchronous response by returning true, but the message channel closed before a response was received`.  This is a high priority.
    *   Examine all asynchronous code (Promises, `async/await`, `fetch`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, WebSocket interactions) for proper error handling.
        *   Every `.then()` should have a corresponding `.catch()` to handle rejections.
        *   Every `async` function should have a `try...catch` block to handle errors.
        *   Ensure that WebSocket connections are properly closed and event listeners are removed when no longer needed.
        *   Check for race conditions where a component might be unmounted before an asynchronous operation completes, leading to attempts to update state on an unmounted component.
3. **Address and fix Invalid href Errors:**
    * The following error is consistently repeated in the console logs:
    * `Invalid href 'https://bb2afc4e-e780-47cf-9519-605ec6fb181c-00-g6uexhd3hcj5.janeway.replit.dev:3001//...' passed to next/router in page: '/replEnvironmentDesktop'. Repeated forward-slashes (//) or backslashes \ are not valid in the href.`.
    * Please find the place in the `_app-*.js` file where the router is used with invalid links and correct it.

4.  **Address Network Errors and Warnings:**
    *   Multiple "Failed to load resource" errors with status codes 401 (Unauthorized) and various `net::ERR_` codes indicate problems with network requests.
        *   Identify the API endpoints being called that are returning 401 errors and ensure the user is properly authenticated. Check session management.
        *   Investigate `net::ERR_NAME_NOT_RESOLVED` errors â€“ these are DNS resolution problems. Make sure the domains are correctly configured and reachable.
        *   Investigate `net::ERR_NETWORK_CHANGED` and `net::ERR_CONNECTION_CLOSED` errors. These could be related to server instability or network interruptions.
        *  Address the 404 errors by identifying and fixing the missing assets.
        * Address any 500 errors by checking for server-side problems.
        * Address any 429 errors (too many requests) by checking for too many requests.

5. **Other considerations:**
    * Pay attention to any warnings related to deprecated features, such as WebGL fallback and the `apple-mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag, and update the code to use the recommended alternatives.
     * Fix any other errors such as`Uncaught ReferenceError: TermsModal is not defined`
     * Address the aria-hidden issue

**Provide the Following:**

1.  **Modified Code:** Provide the corrected code files.
2.  **Explanation:** For *each* fix, provide a clear, concise explanation of:
    *   What the problem was.
    *   What specific code changes were made to fix it.
    *   Why the fix works.

**Prioritization:**

Address the issues in the following order of priority (highest to lowest):

1.  `Uncaught (in promise)` errors.
2.  `MaxListenersExceededWarning` memory leaks.
3.  `Invalid href` routing errors.
4.  Network errors (401, 404, 500, `net::ERR_*`).
5. WebGL and other deprecation warnings.

**Tools and Techniques:**

*   Use the browser's developer tools (especially the Memory and Performance tabs) to identify memory leaks and performance bottlenecks.
*   Use the debugger and console logs extensively to trace execution flow and pinpoint the source of errors.
*   Use a linter (like ESLint) with appropriate rules for React and asynchronous code to catch potential issues.
*   Perform thorough code reviews.
