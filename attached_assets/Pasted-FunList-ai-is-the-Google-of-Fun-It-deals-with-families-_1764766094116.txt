FunList.ai is the "Google of Fun." It deals with families, safety, physical locations, and subjective opinions ("Is this event fun?"). The legal risk here isn't just data; it's Liability (e.g., "The AI said this event was happening, I drove 2 hours, and it was closed" or "The AI said this was kid-friendly, but it wasn't").

Here are the Privacy Policy and Terms of Conditions tailored specifically for the consumer-facing FunList.ai.

1. Privacy Policy (FunList.ai)
Strategy: This policy doubles down on Location Data (essential for hyper-local discovery) and Preference Data (essential for Funalytics™ scoring), while reassuring parents about the "No Cross-Training" guarantee.

                        <li><strong>No Cross-Training:</strong> The preferences you share (e.g., "I like jazz" or "I have toddlers") are used to personalize <em>your</em> Funalytics™ scores. We do not use your private profile to train AI models for third-party advertisers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Privacy:</strong> We use your location to find "Fun near you." We do not sell your location history to data brokers.</li>

                <p>To power the "Local Brain" and Funalytics™ engine, we collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> Name, email, and "Fun Personas" (e.g., Date Night, Family with Kids).</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your geolocation (with consent) to sort events by proximity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Which events you click, save, or share. This helps our "Rating Agent" learn what is actually popular in your community.</li>

                    <li><strong>Funalytics™ Scoring:</strong> To calculate personalized "Fun Scores." (e.g., If you tell us you have kids, we boost the score of events tagged 'Family Friendly').</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Synergy Loop":</strong> We use aggregated data (e.g., "Families are searching for tacos") to help local businesses create better events, but this is never tied to your personal identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To send you weekly "Fun Lists" or alerts about cancelled events.</li>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Event Hosts:</strong> If you explicitly RSVP or buy a ticket through our platform, we share necessary contact info with the host.</li>
                    <li><strong>Within AMA SPC:</strong> Your login works across our network (e.g., BusinessCalendar.ai), so your identity is shared internally for authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>By Law:</strong> If required to protect public safety or comply with a subpoena.</li>

3. Replit Instructions
Copy this into your Replit chat for the FunList.ai project.

PROMPT FOR REPLIT ASSISTANT:

Plaintext

I need to update the legal pages for FunList.ai. These must be consumer-focused (B2C) and address our specific features like "Funalytics" and event discovery.

Please update `templates/privacy.html` and `templates/terms.html` with the content provided above.

Key changes I am making:
1. FUNALYTICS DISCLAIMER: Added specific language to Terms (Section 2) stating that AI scores are subjective opinions, not guarantees.
2. REFERRAL MODEL: Clarified that we link to third-party ticket sellers and are not liable for their transactions.
3. LOCATION PRIVACY: Explicitly addressed how we use geolocation for "Events Near Me."
4. ALIAS STANDARDIZATION: Used `legal@funlist.ai` for data rights and `hello@funlist.ai` for general contact.

Please apply these updates now.
