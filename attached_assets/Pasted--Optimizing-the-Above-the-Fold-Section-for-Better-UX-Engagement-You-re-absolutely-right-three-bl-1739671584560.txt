🔹 Optimizing the Above-the-Fold Section for Better UX & Engagement
You're absolutely right—three blue buttons inside a blue/green gradient feels visually overwhelming and dilutes focus. Also, the "Get My Weekly FunList" CTA should have better visibility & engagement, ideally popping up later if the user hasn't signed up yet.

🔹 Best Practices & Recommended Adjustments
✅ 1. Improve Button Layout & Hierarchy
📌 Problem: Three buttons in a row compete for attention.
📌 Solution:

Make "Get My Weekly FunList" the primary CTA (most prominent).
Reduce visual clutter by adjusting the Map/List View buttons placement.
📌 Updated Layout Strategy:
1️⃣ Main CTA (FunList Sign-Up Button) → Centered, Standalone

This is the most important action, so keep it visually dominant.
2️⃣ Map/List View Buttons → Styled Differently, Positioned Below CTA
Convert them into smaller pill-shaped tabs placed below the main CTA or styled as a toggle switch.
🛠 Developer Instructions:
Keep "Get My Weekly FunList" centered and standalone.
Move "Map View" & "List View" buttons into pill-shaped tabs below the CTA or as a toggle switch.
✅ 2. Add a Sticky (Dismissible) Signup Button Below the Fold
📌 Problem: Users might ignore the signup button above the fold.
📌 Solution:

As users scroll below the fold, a sticky "Get My Weekly FunList" button should slide in at the bottom of the screen.
If the user closes it, it should not reappear for that session.
If the user is logged in, do NOT show it.
🛠 Developer Instructions:
Create a floating/sticky CTA button that appears on scroll.
If dismissed, store a session variable so it doesn’t reappear.
Do NOT show the sticky button if the user is logged in.
📌 Example JavaScript for Scroll-Based Popup CTA:

javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener("DOMContentLoaded", function () {
    let popupCTA = document.getElementById("stickyFunListCTA");

    window.addEventListener("scroll", function () {
        if (window.scrollY > 500 && !sessionStorage.getItem("ctaDismissed")) {
            popupCTA.style.display = "block";
        }
    });

    document.getElementById("closeCTA").addEventListener("click", function () {
        popupCTA.style.display = "none";
        sessionStorage.setItem("ctaDismissed", "true");
    });
});
✅ 3. Adjust Visual Styling for the CTA
📌 Problem: The current "Get My Weekly FunList" button blends too much into the background.
📌 Solution:

Give it a contrasting background color (e.g., yellow, white, or orange) to make it stand out.
Add an email input field directly in the CTA for quick signups.
🛠 Developer Instructions:
Make the signup button pop with a high-contrast color.
Optionally add an input field for direct signup.
Ensure button text is larger for readability.
✅ Final Layout Structure
📌 Above the Fold:
✅ H1 Title: "Find the Best Events Near You – Rated for Fun!"
✅ Main CTA: "Get My Weekly FunList" (Standalone, Prominent, with High-Contrast Color)
✅ Map/List View Toggle: Styled as small tabs or a toggle switch BELOW the CTA.

📌 Below the Fold:
✅ Sticky Floating "Get My Weekly FunList" Button Appears on Scroll
✅ Dismissible (Closes for the session when clicked)
✅ Does NOT appear for logged-in users

🔹 Final Developer Instructions Checklist
✅ 1. Improve Button Hierarchy

Make "Get My Weekly FunList" standalone & prominent.
Convert Map/List View buttons into smaller tabs or a toggle switch.
✅ 2. Add a Sticky (Dismissible) FunList CTA Below the Fold

Appears when user scrolls past 500px.
Closes when dismissed (stored in session).
Hides for logged-in users.
✅ 3. Update CTA Styling for Better Contrast & Readability

Make the button color stand out.
Consider adding a signup field directly in the CTA.
🚀 Why This Works
✔️ Increases Signups by keeping the CTA visible longer.
✔️ Reduces Clutter in the header while keeping important actions accessible.
✔️ Boosts Usability by making navigation simpler & more intuitive.
