Prompt for Replit AI Assistant:

Context:

We are experiencing significant issues with the current state of the application. Previous attempts to fix problems have resulted in a version that is not functioning correctly, and it's unclear how to revert to a known working state. We need to leverage Replit's version control (Git) and rollback features to restore a functional version of the application. I am the developer and have been working with you (The Replit AI Assistant) to make changes.

Instructions:

Identify Recent Problematic Changes:

Review the recent chat history with me (the developer). Identify the specific changes or tasks that were attempted immediately before the application started malfunctioning. Be as specific as possible (e.g., "modifying the footer styling," "updating the signup route," "adding new fields to the User model").

List these problematic changes.

List Recent Commits:

Use the git log command in the Replit shell to list the recent Git commits. Provide the full commit hash, author, date, and commit message for at least the last 5-10 commits.

Do not attempt to interpret the commit messages yourself. Just list them.

Analyze Commit History and Chat History:

Compare the list of problematic changes (from step 1) with the commit history (from step 2). Try to correlate specific changes with specific commits.

If a specific commit message says "Checkpoint made" look for the previous commit, since "Checkpoint made" will not be helpful.

If a commit is identified as likely causing the issues, note its commit hash.

Propose Rollback Strategy:

Based on your analysis, propose a specific rollback strategy. This should include:

Option A (Preferred - Specific Commit): If you can identify a specific commit that represents a known working state before the problems started, provide the full commit hash of that commit. We will use git checkout <commit-hash> to revert to that state.

Option B (Less Precise - Recent Commits): If a precise working commit is hard to pinpoint, suggest rolling back to one of the more recent commits, but before the major issues started. Again, provide the full commit hash. Explain that this is less precise and might require additional adjustments.

Option C (Deployments Tool - If Applicable): If the Replit Deployments tool was used to deploy a previous, working version, explain how to use the Deployments tool to revert to that deployed version. Prioritize this option if a deployment exists. Describe the exact steps to find and use the Deployments tool.

Option D (Last Resort): State how to get the last working commit

Explain and Warn: No matter what version, fully explain the process for rolling back and the implications, for example, that all work will be lost since the rollback

Output:

Provide the following:

A list of the recent problematic changes (from step 1).

The output of the git log command (showing recent commits).

Your analysis of which commit(s) might be related to the issues.

A clear, step-by-step rollback strategy, including the exact commands or steps to use, and choosing one of the options (A, B, C, or D). Include any necessary warnings.

Explanation

Example (Partial Output - Illustrative):

Problematic Changes:

*   Modifying the footer styling (custom.css and base.html)
*   Updating the signup route (routes.py) to handle new fields

Recent Commits (git log output):

commit a1b2c3d4e5f6... (HEAD -> main)
Author: Replit AI Assistant <...>
Date:   Tue Feb 20 14:30:00 2025 +0000

    Update signup route to handle new fields

commit f7g8h9i0j1k2...
Author: Replit AI Assistant <...>
Date:   Tue Feb 20 14:00:00 2025 +0000

    Modify footer styling

commit l3m4n5o6p7q8...
Author: My Name <myemail@example.com>
Date:   Tue Feb 20 12:00:00 2025 +0000

    Initial commit of working version

Analysis:

It appears the problems started after the changes to the footer styling and the signup route.  Commit `f7g8h9i0j1k2...` and `a1b2c3d4e5f6...` are the likely culprits.  Commit `l3m4n5o6p7q8...` is described as a "working version," so it's the best candidate for rollback.

Rollback Strategy (Option A - Specific Commit):

We recommend rolling back to commit `l3m4n5o6p7q8...` because it's described as a working version.

1.  Open the Replit shell.
2.  Run the following command:
    ```bash
    git checkout l3m4n5o6p7q8...
    ```
3.  This will revert your codebase to the state it was in at that commit.  *Warning: Any changes made after this commit will be lost.*
4.  After rolling back, test the application thoroughly to ensure it's functioning correctly.
