Objective:
Implement a “quick select” date filter feature on both the /events and /map pages, allowing users to choose from preset date ranges (e.g., “Today,” “This Weekend,” “Next 7 Days,” “All Dates”) or select a custom date range using a date picker. Ensure that the UI is fully responsive and works seamlessly on both mobile and desktop devices.

Key Requirements & Steps:

Add a Date Filter Dropdown

Create a dropdown labeled “Dates” or “All Dates” that appears on both the /events and /map pages.
Include options for:
All Dates (default)
Today
This Weekend
Next 7 Days
Custom Range…
Handle Preset Ranges

When a user selects a preset, automatically map it to start_date and end_date. For example:
Today: Set both start_date and end_date to the current date.
This Weekend: Calculate the upcoming Friday (or appropriate day) as the start and the following Sunday as the end date.
Next 7 Days: Set start_date to today and end_date to today + 7 days.
Pass these dates to the Flask backend via GET parameters (e.g., ?start_date=YYYY-MM-DD&end_date=YYYY-MM-DD).
Custom Range Date Picker

If the user selects “Custom Range…,” display a date range picker (e.g., Flatpickr in range mode or a similar lightweight alternative).
Collect the two dates (start_date and end_date) from the user and include them in the GET request to the backend.
Responsive Design:
Ensure the date picker and dropdown work effectively on mobile (touch-friendly, responsive layout) and on desktop.
Use Bootstrap 5’s grid and responsive classes to adjust the UI as needed.
Flask Backend Query

In your Flask routes for both /events and /map, retrieve the date parameters from the request.
If start_date and end_date are provided, use SQLAlchemy to filter events:
python
Copy
events = Event.query.filter(Event.event_date >= start_date,
                            Event.event_date <= end_date).all()
If no date range is selected (or “All Dates”), default to returning all events or a broader time window as appropriate.
Performance & Security

Ensure the event_date column is indexed in PostgreSQL for optimal query performance.
Validate user inputs server-side (e.g., confirming that start_date is not later than end_date).
Continue using CSRF protection (via Flask-WTF) and rate limiting (via Flask-Limiter).
UI/UX & Cross-Page Consistency

Consistency: Apply the same date filter UI changes to both the /events and /map pages.
Mobile and Desktop:
Test and adjust the layout to ensure it looks good and functions properly on both mobile and desktop devices.
Use responsive design techniques (Bootstrap classes, media queries) so that the filter dropdown and date picker are optimized for different screen sizes.
User Guidance:
Provide clear labeling and tooltips or placeholder text (e.g., “Select a date range or choose a preset”) to help users understand how to use the filter.
Testing

Thoroughly test the feature on both pages and across devices:
Presets: Verify that selecting a preset correctly updates the query.
Custom Range: Check that the date picker works on mobile and desktop, and that the custom range is correctly passed to the backend.
Edge Cases: Validate behavior when no date is selected, invalid ranges are entered, etc.
