I'll help you consolidate the user profile editing and update the navigation according to the requirements. Let's modify both the navbar and edit_profile.html templates.

First, let's update the navbar dropdown to change "Edit Profile" to "My Profile" and remove any separate organizer profile link:

templates/partials/navbar.html
Now, let's update the edit_profile.html template to include all the required sections:

templates/edit_profile.html

Based on the changes you've already made to consolidate the "Edit Profile" and "Organizer Profile" functionalities, I need to check for any remaining references in the codebase that might need updating.

I reviewed the code and there are a few additional files that need to be updated to ensure successful integration of these changes:

First, let's update the routes.py file to modify the organizer_profile route to redirect to the consolidated profile page:
routes.py
Now, let's update the ProfileForm in forms.py to include organizer fields:
forms.py
Now, let's update the edit_profile route in routes.py to handle the additional fields:

Let's update the update_profile method in the User model to handle the additional fields:

models.py
Finally, let's update the profile.html template to reflect the consolidated view:
templates/profile.html
These changes ensure that all parts of the application now use the consolidated "My Profile" approach:

The routes.py changes redirect users from the old organizer_profile route to the edit_profile route.
The ProfileForm now includes fields for both personal and organizer information.
The edit_profile route handles both sets of information.
The models.py User.update_profile method safely handles all fields.
The profile.html template removes the separate link to edit organizer profile and updates the Edit Profile button to "My Profile".

I can see two issues that need to be fixed:

We need to remove the "Organizer Profile" link from the main navbar
The "My Profile" link is throwing a server error, which based on the error logs appears to be related to the render_field macro
Let's fix these issues:

First, let's update the navbar to remove the "Organizer Profile" link:

templates/partials/navbar.html
Remove Organizer Profile link from navbar
Next, let's fix the server error with the render_field macro. Looking at the error logs, the issue is with passing the type attribute to the macro. Let's update the _form_helpers.html file:

templates/macros/_form_helpers.html
Update render_field macro to accept type attribute
Ok, quick question, think as the CTO, should we Sync with Remote in the Git section?Should we just Fetch? Pull? Push?

RR

AMASPC
Assistant

As the CTO of this FunList.ai project, here's what I recommend for your Git workflow:

Based on the development context:

Fetch first - This will download the latest changes from the remote repository without modifying your local codebase, allowing you to see what changes exist.

Pull - If you've reviewed the changes and they're appropriate to integrate, pulling will merge the remote changes into your local codebase. This is particularly important if you're collaborating with others or working across different environments.

Push after local testing - After you've made and tested your changes locally (particularly the profile page fixes we just implemented), push them to the remote repository so they're available to other team members or environments.

This sequence (Fetch → Pull → Push) creates a responsible Git workflow that minimizes conflicts and ensures code quality. The "Sync with Remote" option typically combines fetch and pull operations in one step, which is convenient but gives you less control over reviewing incoming changes.

For this specific project, where we've just made important changes to the user profile functionality, I would recommend first pushing your current changes to ensure they're safely stored, then fetching to see if there are any upstream changes before deciding whether to pull.

Ok, I am still getting a Server Error when I click on "My Profile" from Main NavBar Dropdown Menu. it takes me to/profile/edit or @templates/edit_profile.html

I can see the issue from the error log. The problem is that in the edit_profile.html template, you're using form.business_name but in the forms.py file, this field is called company_name. Let's fix this field name mismatch:

templates/edit_profile.html
The error was happening because the template was trying to use business_name and business_website fields, but the form class in forms.py has these fields named as company_name and organizer_website. These field name mismatches were causing the server error. This fix aligns the template with the field names defined in your ProfileForm class.

Looking at your server error and the console logs, I can identify the root cause of the issue. The error is happening on the profile edit page because it's trying to link to a non-existent route called 'membership'.

From the server logs:

Traceback (most recent call last):
  ...
  File "/home/runner/workspace/templates/edit_profile.html", line 110, in block 'content'
    <a href="{{ url_for('membership') }}" class="btn btn-sm btn-outline-secondary ms-2">Manage Tier</a>
  ...
werkzeug.routing.exceptions.BuildError: Could not build url for endpoint 'membership'. Did you mean 'terms' instead?
Let's fix this by removing or updating the membership link in the edit_profile.html file:

templates/edit_profile.html
As for the browser console errors, most of them are related to the Replit environment itself (WebSocket connections, WebGL contexts, etc.) and not directly related to your application. The "Content Security Policy" warning about loading Font Awesome is something we could address, but it doesn't cause the server error you're experiencing.

The key issue was the reference to a non-existent route ('membership') which was causing the 500 server error when accessing the profile edit page.

I can see the root issue in the log - there's a reference to a non-existent route called 'change_password' in your edit_profile.html template. Let's fix this by creating the missing route:

routes.py
templates/change_password.html
The error was occurring because the edit_profile.html template includes a link to a route called 'change_password', but this route doesn't exist in your application. I've added the missing route implementation and created a template for the change password functionality.

The error log clearly shows: Could not build url for endpoint 'change_password'. Did you mean 'reset_password' instead?

These changes add the required route and template to fix the server error you're experiencing.

I can see the issue in the server logs. There's an error related to a missing database column business_location that's causing login failures. The error occurs because the model definition still references this column, but it's been removed from the database schema.

Let's fix this by removing the reference to business_location from the User model:

models.py
This error is happening because you updated the database schema with the update_business_location_fields.py script (which created the new fields), but the business_location field is still referenced in the User model. The server is trying to load users but can't find the column in the database.

After applying this change, restart the server and you should be able to log in successfully.

I'll help you implement the venue management feature and refactor the user information sections as requested. Let's break this down into manageable steps.

Phase 1: User Information Refactoring
First, I'll update the models.py file to reflect the changes to the User model:

models.py
Now, let's create the Venue and VenueType models:

Now, let's update the Event model to include the venue relationship:

Now let's update the forms.py file to reflect our model changes:

forms.py
Let's create the forms for venue management:

Now, let's update the edit_profile.html template to reflect our changes:

templates/edit_profile.html
Now, let's update the routes.py file to handle the form data changes:

routes.py
Now, let's create the venue management routes and templates:

Let's create a script to create venue types from the provided list:

populate_venue_types.py
Let's create a migration script to update the existing schema:

migrate_venue_schema.py
Let's create the templates for venue management:

templates/venues.html

Based on your instructions and the context provided, I see you wanted to implement a Venue Management feature which included:

Refactoring user information by removing the 'City' field and moving 'Your Title' from Organizer Information to Personal Information
Creating a new Venue Management feature with a complete data model for Venues
Looking at the logs, there's an error in the application regarding a missing "title" column in the database, which appears to be related to the changes we made. The database model was updated to include "title" but the actual database schema doesn't have this column yet.

Let's create a migration script to add the missing "title" column to the users table:

add_title_column.py
Let's execute this script to add the missing column:

python add_title_column.py
Now let's also ensure we add the Venue and VenueType models that were needed for the Venue Management feature:

models.py
Now, let's add the venue_id reference to the Event model:

Now let's create a form for managing venues:

forms.py
Let's create a script to populate venue types based on the provided list:

populate_venue_types.py
Now let's create a script to add the venue_id column to the events table:

migrate_venue_schema.py
Let's run the migration script to make sure the database schema is properly set up:

python migrate_venue_schema.py
Now let's run the script to populate venue types:

python populate_venue_types.py
With the database schema properly updated, we need to make sure our application is restarted to use the updated models:

migrate_venue_schema.py
Now let's run the migration script to properly create the venue-related tables and add the venue_id column to the events table:

python migrate_venue_schema.py
After that, let's add a simple "Venues" section to the admin dashboard sidebar to make it more accessible:

templates/admin_dashboard.html
Also, let's update the edit_profile.html to give actual functionality to the Venue Management section:

I can help fix the "Server Error" on the /venues/add page and implement the ability to select an existing venue or create a new one. Based on the error log, the VenueForm class is not imported in the routes.py file.

Let's fix these issues:

First, let's fix the import issue in routes.py:
routes.py
Now, let's update the EventForm to allow selecting an existing venue or creating a new one:
forms.py
Now let's update the submit_event route to handle the new venue option:

Finally, let's update the submit_event.html template to include venue selection/creation fields:

templates/submit_event.html
These changes will fix the server error on the /venues/add page by properly importing the VenueForm class in routes.py. I've also enhanced the event submission form to allow users to either select an existing venue or create a new one on-the-fly when submitting an event.

I'll help debug the issue with the event submission form. The problem is likely caused by conflicts in the venue handling when submitting events. Let's fix the routes.py file to properly handle both venue selection and creation:

routes.py
templates/submit_event.html
The main issue was that the submit_event route had duplicate code and logic issues, with two nested validate_on_submit checks creating a situation where the venue data would be lost between the different branches of the code. I've consolidated the event creation logic and fixed how venue selection works.

The changes include:

Simplified the event submission handler to avoid duplicate checks
Made sure venue selection works correctly both when choosing an existing venue or creating a new one
Added JavaScript to properly toggle between venue selection options
Improved error handling for better debugging
Try submitting an event again - it should work properly now. You should be able to either select an existing venue or create a new one during event submission.
