Website to Audit:
BusinessCalendar.ai
Audit Objectives (Minimum Requirements):
For the specified website, the Replit agent is to perform the following:
Identify Core Technical Stack:
Programming Languages: Determine all programming languages used (e.g., Python, Node.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, PHP, Ruby, Java, Go). Specify versions if discernible.
Frameworks: Identify any web frameworks (e.g., Flask, Django, Express.js, React, Angular, Vue.js, Next.js, FastAPI, Spring Boot, Ruby on Rails) and their versions.
Database Solutions: Identify any in-use database systems (e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, Redis) and how they are accessed or configured within the Replit environment. Note if an ORM (Object-Relational Mapper) is used.
Package Managers: Identify package managers in use (e.g., npm, yarn, pip, poetry, bundler).
Environment Configuration: Identify any .env files or other environment variable configurations.
Document Feature Implementations:
Maps Feature:
How is the map displayed (e.g., Google Maps API, Leaflet, OpenLayers)?
What data source does it use for locations?
Is it interactive (e.g., markers, search, routing)?
How is map data stored or generated (e.g., KML files, direct database query)?
FAQ Pages:
How are FAQ content and structure managed (e.g., static HTML, markdown, database-driven)?
Are they dynamic or static?
About Pages:
How is the content managed (e.g., static HTML, markdown, CMS)?
Login/Authentication Process:
What authentication methods are used (e.g., username/password, OAuth, social login)?
How are user credentials stored and managed (e.g., hashed passwords, session management)?
What libraries or frameworks facilitate authentication?
Newsletter Subscriptions:
How are email addresses collected?
Is there an integration with an external email service provider (ESP) or an internal storage mechanism?
What validation rules are applied?
Identify AI Assistant Integrations:
Presence: For the specified site, confirm if an AI assistant (e.g., Buyer's Agent, Seller's Agent, Personal Fun Assistant, Dating Assistant, Calendar Assistant) is present.
Underlying Mechanism: If an AI assistant exists, describe its mechanism:
Does it use a direct API call to an LLM (e.g., Gemini API)?
Is there an intermediary framework or library (e.g., LangChain, LlamaIndex, custom Genkit-like implementation)?
How is user input processed and responses generated?
How is "memory" or context maintained for the AI assistant?
Identify any configuration files or code snippets related to AI model selection or prompting.
Output Format:
For the specified website, provide a detailed markdown summary adhering to the following structure:
