# Funalytics™ FAQ

## Who makes the score?
An automated FunList.ai engine (not a human). It uses event details and simple rules to estimate fit.

## What does the score mean?
A quick read on likely enjoyment. Facets (CommunityVibe™, FamilyFun™) roll up into an Overall 0–10.

## When is it updated?
On create, on edit, and periodically if details change.

## Where do I see it?
Event cards (compact badges) and event pages (full breakdown + a short reason).

## Why trust it?
It's consistent, transparent (short "why"), and improves as organizers include richer details.

## How can organizers improve scores?
Clear family-friendly signals, community elements, accurate schedules, venue info, and tags. Avoid ambiguous descriptions.

## Can scores be wrong?
They can be imperfect—details matter. We keep a history and will refine logic and signals over time.

## Is it personalized?
MVP is general-purpose. Personalization (by taste/location) comes later.

## Do you rate safety or political content?
No. MVP facets focus on community & family friendliness; we avoid sensitive judgments.

## Can I opt out?
If an organizer opts out, events won't show a Funalytics score (policy TBD).
