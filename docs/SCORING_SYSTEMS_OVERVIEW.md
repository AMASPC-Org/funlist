## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Central Scoring API
All scoring systems are powered by a unified **Central API** that provides:

- **Generic Endpoints**: `/scores/latest` and `/scores/compute` supporting all brands
- **Adapter Registry**: Pluggable scoring algorithms for easy extension
- **Shared Database**: Generic scores table with JSON dimensions for flexibility
- **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy API routes continue working seamlessly

### Multi-Brand Data Model

```typescript
interface Score {
  id: string;
  brand: 'funlist' | 'businesscalendar';
  system: 'Funalytics' | 'ConnectScore' | 'Elevate';
  entityType: 'event' | 'venue' | 'experience';
  entityId: number;
  overallScore: number;
  dimensions: Record<string, number>; // Flexible JSON structure
  reasoning: string;
  computedAt: Date;
}
```

### Algorithm Adapters

Each scoring system implements a common interface:

```typescript
interface ScoringAdapter {
  computeScore(params: {
    entityType: string;
    entity: EntityData;
  }): Promise<{
    overallScore: number;
    dimensions: Record<string, number>;
    reasoning: string;
    status: 'completed' | 'failed';
  }>;
}
```

## üîÑ API Integration

### Generic Multi-Brand API

```bash
# Get latest scores for any brand/system
GET /scores/latest?brand=funlist&system=Funalytics&entityType=event

# Compute new scores
POST /scores/compute
{
  "brand": "businesscalendar",
  "system": "ConnectScore", 
  "entityType": "event",
  "entityId": 123
}
```

### Backward Compatibility

```bash
# Legacy FunList API continues working
GET /funalytics/latest?entityType=event&entityId=123
POST /funalytics/compute
{
  "entityType": "event",
  "entityId": 123
}
```

## üìä Scoring Algorithm Summary

| Brand | System | Primary Focus | Key Dimensions | Target Score Range |
|-------|--------|---------------|----------------|-------------------|
| FunList | Funalytics‚Ñ¢ | Family/Community Fun | CommunityVibe, FamilyFun | 0-10 (higher = more fun) |
| BusinessCalendar | ConnectScore‚Ñ¢ | Professional Networking | NetworkingPotential, IndustryRelevance, CareerImpact | 0-10 (higher = better networking) |
| BusinessCalendar | Elevate‚Ñ¢ | Career Development | SkillBuilding, LeadershipExposure, GrowthPotential | 0-10 (higher = more growth) |

## üöÄ Benefits of Multi-Brand Architecture

### For Users
- **Specialized Experiences**: Scoring tailored to specific needs and contexts
- **Cross-Brand Discovery**: Professional users can still access family events when needed
- **Improved Relevance**: Algorithms optimized for distinct user personas

### For Platform
- **Scalable Design**: Easy addition of new brands and scoring systems
- **Shared Infrastructure**: Reduced development and maintenance overhead
- **Unified Analytics**: Cross-brand insights and trend analysis
- **Backward Compatibility**: Smooth transition from single-brand system

## üîÆ Future Expansion

The multi-brand architecture enables easy addition of new scoring systems:

- **WellnessCalendar** ‚Üí **HealthScore‚Ñ¢** (fitness events, wellness workshops)
- **CreativeEvents** ‚Üí **InspirationMeter‚Ñ¢** (artistic events, creative workshops)  
- **TechEvents** ‚Üí **InnovationIndex‚Ñ¢** (tech conferences, startup events)
