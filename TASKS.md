## ðŸš§ Phase 1: MVP Foundation (Replit Dev Only)

### 1. Database & Backend (local Prisma + SQLite in Replit)
- [ ] Configure Prisma ORM to use SQLite for local dev.  
- [ ] Implement User, Event, Venue, Favorite models (match schema.sql).  
- [ ] Add seed script with sample users, events, venues.  
- [ ] Expose REST endpoints for:  
  - User registration/login (attendee, organizer, admin).  
  - Event submission (organizer).  
  - Event search + filter (date/location).  
  - Favorites (attendees save events).  

### 2. Core Features
- [ ] Event submission form (organizer).  
- [ ] Event discovery UI (attendee list + search).  
- [ ] Personal Fun Assistant (chat UI stub with mock data).  
- [ ] Display Fun Ratings (static values for now).  

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Add integration tests for user login + event submission.  
- [ ] Add sample test for Fun Assistant chat flow.

## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Replit AI: Use **SQLite** in dev (`file:./dev.db`) to avoid Cloud SQL setup.  
- Schema and ORM must stay aligned (see schema.sql and prisma/schema.prisma).  
- Commit code in small steps so features can be tested incrementally.
