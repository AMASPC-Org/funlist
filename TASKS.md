## üöÄ PHASE 1.5: MULTI-BRAND SCORING SYSTEM (IN PROGRESS)

### Architectural Transformation ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Monorepo Structure**: Created `/apps/central-api`, `/packages/shared-schemas` for multi-brand architecture
- ‚úÖ **Shared Schemas**: Zod validators and TypeScript types for consistent data validation
- ‚úÖ **Generic Scores API**: Central API serves `/scores/latest` and `/scores/compute` endpoints
- ‚úÖ **Adapter Registry**: Pluggable scoring systems (Funalytics, ConnectScore, Elevate)
- ‚úÖ **Database Schema**: Generic scores table with JSON dimensions for flexible multi-brand data

### Multi-Brand Implementation Status
- ‚úÖ **Adapter Implementation**: All three scoring algorithms (Funalytics, ConnectScore, Elevate)
- ‚úÖ **Multi-brand Database**: Generic scores table supporting all brands and systems
- üîÑ **Backward Compatibility**: Legacy `/funalytics/*` routes for seamless migration
- ‚è≥ **Flask App Migration**: Move current Flask app to `/apps/funlist` structure
- ‚è≥ **BusinessCalendar App**: New brand implementation with ConnectScore/Elevate integration
- ‚è≥ **Integration Tests**: Multi-brand testing suite for all scoring systems
- ‚úÖ **Canonical docs completed**: Comprehensive documentation for all scoring systems

### Documentation & Knowledge Base ‚úÖ
- ‚úÖ **Multi-Brand Overview**: `docs/SCORING_SYSTEMS_OVERVIEW.md` - complete system architecture
- ‚úÖ **Funalytics Documentation**: `docs/FUNALYTICS_DOCS.md` - comprehensive guide with FAQ, rubric, examples
- ‚úÖ **ConnectScore/Elevate Documentation**: `docs/CONNECT_SCORE_DOCS.md` - professional scoring systems guide
- ‚úÖ **Updated Project Plan**: Reflects current multi-brand architecture and progress
