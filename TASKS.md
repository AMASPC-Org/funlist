## Priority: API Foundation & Testing

### ðŸŽ¯ High Priority (This Sprint)

#### âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] Express.js sidecar API setup with Prisma
- [x] GET /events endpoint with venue, organizer, funalytics scores  
- [x] POST /events endpoint with validation
- [x] API documentation in /api/README.md with curl examples
- [x] CORS configuration for cross-origin requests

#### âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Add integration test suite** (npm test) for API validation - 10 tests passing
- [x] **Update roadmap.md** to mark API endpoint structure complete

#### âœ… COMPLETED
- [x] **Replace mock data** with real database - WORKING! 25 events, 9 users connected

- [ ] Pagination for large event lists  
- [ ] API versioning strategy
- [ ] Performance monitoring

## Current Blockers
- **Flask Database**: Flask migrations needed to create real database tables
- **LSP Errors**: 15 diagnostics in models.py need resolution

## Testing Strategy
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual endpoint validation
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end API workflows  
3. **Manual Testing**: curl/Postman verification
4. **Automated Testing**: npm test suite

## Notes
- API running successfully on port 3001
- Flask app running on port 8080  
- Mock data working for API demonstration
- Ready for real database integration

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All API endpoints tested and documented
- [ ] Integration test suite passing
- [ ] Real database connected and working
- [ ] No blocking LSP errors
- [ ] Performance baseline established
