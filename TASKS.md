## ðŸ“Œ Notes
- Development is **Replit-first** using SQLite + Prisma for local dev.
- Shared PostgreSQL DB is used for real data testing.
- Cloud deployment + CI/CD are **explicitly deferred** until Phase 3.
- These files (`PROJECT_PLAN.md` & `TASKS.md`) are the **single source of truth** for all contributors and Replit AI.
