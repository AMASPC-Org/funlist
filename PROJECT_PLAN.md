# FunList.ai Project Plan

## Current Phase: MVP Foundation (Phase 1)

### Development Environment
- **Primary Development**: Replit with SQLite + Prisma
- **Architecture**: Flask web app + Express.js API sidecar
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (shared between Flask and Express)
- **Deployment**: Cloud deployment deferred until MVP validation

### Phase 1 Goals
Create a working MVP that validates the core concept of AI-powered event discovery with Fun Rating System.

#### âœ… Completed
- Basic Flask application setup
- Database schema implementation  
- User authentication system
- Event creation and management
- Event discovery implementation
- **NEW**: Express.js API endpoint structure with Prisma

#### âœ… Completed
- Integration testing for API endpoints (10 tests passing)
- Real database connection with 25+ events and 9 users
- Express.js API fully functional with Prisma ORM

#### ðŸ”„ In Progress
- Search and filter functionality
- Fun Score system implementation

#### ðŸ“‹ Upcoming (Phase 1)
- Complete API endpoint finalization
- Basic testing & validation
- Performance baseline establishment

### Phase 2: Feature Enhancement (Future)
- Digital Advertising system
- Stripe integration
- Advanced search functionality
- Mobile API optimization

### Phase 3: Scale & Deploy (Future)  
- Cloud deployment
- CI/CD pipeline
- Domain setup and production environment
- Performance optimization
- Security hardening

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Dual Backend**: Flask for web interface, Express.js for API
2. **Shared Database**: Single PostgreSQL instance
3. **API-First**: REST endpoints for future mobile/integration needs
4. **Incremental Development**: Working features over complete systems

### Success Metrics (Phase 1)
- Functional event creation/discovery workflow
- API endpoints responding correctly
- Basic user authentication working
- Database operations stable
- Core Fun Rating System functional
