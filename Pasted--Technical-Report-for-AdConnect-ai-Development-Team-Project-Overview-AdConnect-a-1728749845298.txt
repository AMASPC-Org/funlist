### Technical Report for AdConnect.ai Development Team

---

**Project Overview**  
AdConnect.ai is a hyper-local advertising platform designed to connect businesses, nonprofits, and organizations with regional marketing opportunities. The primary focus of the platform is to facilitate real-time advertising and sponsorship transactions, providing tools for users to create, manage, search, and bulk upload listings, integrated with FunList.ai for cross-platform sponsor visibility.

### 1. Password Reset Functionality
**Objective**: Enhance user experience by adding a password reset option during login.

- **Process**: Implement a "Forgot your password?" link on the login page. The backend should send an automated email containing a secure password reset link, valid for a limited period (e.g., 1 hour).
  
```python
def send_reset_link(user_email):
    token = generate_reset_token(user_email)
    reset_url = f"{app_url}/reset-password/{token}"
    send_email(user_email, subject="Password Reset", body=f"Click to reset: {reset_url}")
    return {"message": "Reset link sent!"}
```

- **Security**: Ensure the link expires after a set duration to mitigate unauthorized use.

### 2. Footer Copyright Update
**Objective**: Update the copyright year to 2024.

- **Task**: In the website’s footer, update the copyright text to:  
  ```html
  <footer>© 2024 AdConnect.ai. All rights reserved. Powered by <a href="https://localmarketingtool.com">LocalMarketingTool.com</a></footer>
  ```

### 3. Registration: Additional User Groups & Multiple Selections
**Objective**: Allow users to select one or more user groups during registration to enable targeted recommendations.

- **User Group Categories**:  
  - Young Adult
  - Couple
  - 21+

**Implementation Logic for Event List Generation**: Users selecting multiple categories (e.g., Senior & Single) will see events that cater to overlapping interests.

```python
def generate_event_list(user_groups):
    all_events = fetch_all_events()
    return [event for event in all_events if event.matches_user_groups(user_groups)]
```

- **UX/UI**:  
  - Use intuitive checkboxes for multiple selections.
  - Provide tooltips explaining that selecting multiple categories improves recommendations.

### 4. Weekly Fun List Email Opt-In
**Objective**: Add an opt-in checkbox for receiving the Weekly Fun List email.

- **Implementation**:  
  ```html
  <input type="checkbox" name="weekly_fun_list" value="yes"> I would like to receive the Weekly Fun List Email for events in my area.
  ```

**Backend**:
```python
def register_user(user_data):
    if user_data.get('weekly_fun_list'):
        subscribe_to_weekly_list(user_data['email'])
```

### 5. UX/UI Enhancements with Tooltips
**Objective**: Ensure the UI/UX is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, guiding users through the process of selecting categories.

- **Recommendations**:  
  - Use tooltips for category selection to clarify that multiple groups can be chosen.  
  - Implement real-time feedback as users make selections.

```javascript
// Example of real-time feedback for multiple category selection
document.querySelectorAll('input[type=checkbox]').forEach(checkbox => {
  checkbox.addEventListener('change', function() {
    let selectedGroups = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll('input[type=checkbox]:checked')).map(cb => cb.value);
    document.querySelector('#feedback').innerText = `You have selected: ${selectedGroups.join(', ')}`;
  });
});
```

### 10. Notifications System
**Objective**: Build a robust notification system for all users.

- **Firebase Integration**: Use Firebase for push notifications for events like listing approvals or inquiries.

```javascript
// Example of Firebase push notifications setup
firebase.messaging().onMessage((payload) => {
  displayNotification(payload.notification.title, payload.notification.body);
});
```

### 11. Scalability, Performance, and Security
- **Scalability**: Use Google Cloud Load Balancer and Kubernetes (GKE) for handling traffic spikes. 
- **Data Security**: Ensure API and data security using OAuth 2.0 and Google Cloud KMS for encryption.
