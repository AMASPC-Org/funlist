                    <p>FunList.ai is part of the AMA Social Purpose Corporation network. We operate under a strict <strong>Data Sovereignty</strong> model designed to protect local families and businesses:</p>
                    <ul class="mb-0">
                        <li><strong>No Cross-Training:</strong> The preferences you share (e.g., "I like jazz" or "I have toddlers") are used to personalize <em>your</em> Funalytics™ scores. We do not use your private profile to train AI models for third-party advertisers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Location Privacy:</strong> We use your location to find "Fun near you." We do not sell your location history to data brokers.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">2. Information We Collect</h2>
                <p>To power the "Local Brain" and Funalytics™ engine, we collect:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Profile Data:</strong> Name, email, and "Fun Personas" (e.g., Date Night, Family with Kids).</li>
                    <li><strong>Location Data:</strong> Your geolocation (with consent) to sort events by proximity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Usage Data:</strong> Which events you click, save, or share. This helps our "Rating Agent" learn what is actually popular in your community.</li>
                    <li><strong>Device Data:</strong> IP address and browser type for security and fraud prevention.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section mb-5">
                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Funalytics™ Scoring:</strong> To calculate personalized "Fun Scores." (e.g., If you tell us you have kids, we boost the score of events tagged 'Family Friendly').</li>
                    <li><strong>The "Synergy Loop":</strong> We use aggregated data (e.g., "Families are searching for tacos") to help local businesses create better events, but this is never tied to your personal identity.</li>
                    <li><strong>Service Delivery:</strong> To send you weekly "Fun Lists" or alerts about cancelled events.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

            <div class="privacy-section mb-5">
                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">4. Information Sharing</h2>
                <p>We do not sell your personal data. We share data only:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>With Event Hosts:</strong> If you explicitly RSVP or buy a ticket through our platform, we share necessary contact info with the host.</li>
                    <li><strong>Within AMA SPC:</strong> Your login works across our network (e.g., BusinessCalendar.ai), so your identity is shared internally for authentication.</li>
                    <li><strong>By Law:</strong> If required to protect public safety or comply with a subpoena.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>

                <h2 class="h4 mb-3">5. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>While FunList.ai lists family-friendly events, our platform is <strong>not intended for use by children under 13</strong>. We do not knowingly collect data from children. If you believe we have inadvertently collected such data, please contact our Trust Officer immediately.</p>

                    <li><strong>AI Personalization:</strong> You can reset your "Fun Persona" preferences in your account settings.</li>
