I can assist with all the elements you're requesting for your platform's registration and login processes. Here's a breakdown of the steps and suggestions:

### 1. **Password Reset Functionality**:
   Adding a password reset option on the login page is essential for user experience. Here's a recommendation:
   - **Process**: Add a "Forgot your password?" link on the login page. When clicked, this link will take users to a form where they enter their email address to receive a reset link.
   - **Action**: Ensure the backend sends an automated email with a secure link to reset the password. Consider setting an expiration time for the link (e.g., 1 hour).

### 2. **Footer Copyright Update**:
   You want to update the website’s footer to reflect the year 2024. Simply change the text in the footer to:

### 3. **Registration: Additional User Groups**:
   Currently, you have categories like "Adult", "Parent", "Single", and "Senior" in your registration. To enhance the list and cater to diverse user profiles for personalized recommendations in the weekly Fun List, here are some additional categories to consider:
   - **"Family"**: For users representing households with multiple members.
   - **"Teen"**: To attract younger users interested in local events for teenagers.
   - **"Young Adult"**: A separate group for individuals in their late teens to mid-20s, which might have different interests than other adults.
   - **"Couple"**: A category to target partnered individuals looking for events or experiences together.

   By expanding the groups, you'll be able to provide more relevant event recommendations and enhance the user experience, helping users to opt in to the most suitable weekly Fun List email.

### 4. **Weekly Fun List Email Opt-In**:
   For the email opt-in, it is best to include a simple checkbox during registration:
   - **Text Example**: "I would like to receive the Weekly Fun List Email for events in my area."
   - This ensures users consciously opt-in for communication, aligning with best practices and privacy regulations like GDPR and CCPA【14†source】【19†source】.

Incorporating these changes should improve the user experience, target specific user segments more effectively, and drive engagement with your platform.
